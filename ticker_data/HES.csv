4447,HES,HESS CORP,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M). The E&P segment explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The R&M segment manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum and other energy products. The Corporation’s goal for the E&P segment is to grow reserves and production profitably with its portfolio of development projects and to deliver exploration success. During 2002 and 2003, the Corporation reshaped its E&P asset portfolio by: • Selling higher cost properties predominantly in the shallow water Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea for proceeds of $738 million. • Exchanging interests in mature producing assets for increased interests in development stage assets in the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. • Participating in two oil discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The asset sales and exchanges contributed significantly to the decline in production from 451,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2002 to 342,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2004. In 2005, the Corporation forecasts that crude oil and natural gas production will average 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2004, the Corporation continued to make progress in its development projects that are expected to provide significant new production in 2006 and 2007, which will more than offset natural declines in existing fields. Milestones accomplished on our development projects in 2004 were: • In April, the Llano Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico commenced production. The Corporation has a 50% interest in this field and net production at year-end is averaging approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. • In August, the government of Equatorial Guinea approved the development plan for the Corporation’s Northern Block G fields, which is now called the Okume Complex. The Corporation anticipates first production in 2007. • In August, the second phase of the project to redevelop the Gassi El Agreb fields in Algeria was approved, resulting in an increased investment commitment of approximately $400 million. This change reflects the Corporation’s success in the area. Since 2000, the Corporation has increased gross production from 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. • In December, the Corporation negotiated additional gas sales from Block A-18 in the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area. The Corporation anticipates that this agreement will allow it to double proved reserves on the field over the next several years and contribute to future production growth. First sales of natural gas from this block under the original gas sales agreement began in 2005. • In December, the Corporation approved the Ujung Pangkah development in Indonesia. Gas sales should commence by early 2007. • In the United Kingdom, first production from the Clair Field commenced in 2005 and production from the Atlantic and Cromarty gas fields is expected to commence in 2006. Combined net production from these three fields is anticipated to be at an annualized rate of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day when all three fields are onstream in 2006. During 2004, the Corporation drilled successful appraisal wells at the Shenzi prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, at the Phu Horm Field onshore Thailand, and at Ujung Pangkah. In December, the Corporation announced a natural gas discovery at the Belud prospect offshore Malaysia. The Corporation has an inventory of exploration prospects and will drill several high impact wells in 2005. The Corporation has two exploration wells currently drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that will have estimated pre-tax capitalized drilling costs of approximately $100 to $110 million upon completion. If either or both of these wells are unsuccessful, after-tax first quarter 2005 earnings would be reduced by up to $70 million. 17 Table of Contents Proved reserves increased to 1.046 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2004 from 1.035 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2003. The Corporation’s reserves included in this Form 10-K are calculated by an independent third party reserve engineer. See further discussion of management’s governance over the estimation of oil and gas reserves in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on page 73. The strategic goals for R&M are to maximize returns from existing assets and generate free cash flow. The Corporation may grow the retail and energy marketing businesses opportunistically. During 2004 and 2003, the R&M segment’s results improved significantly, primarily due to higher refining margins. The HOVENSA and Port Reading refineries operated near maximum capacity for most of the year, enabling them to take full advantage of the strong margins. HOVENSA’s capacity to process lower cost heavy crude oil enhanced profitability in 2004, due to a significant price differential between light and heavy crude oil. In 2004, the Corporation received a cash distribution of $88 million from HOVENSA. The HOVENSA fluid catalytic cracking unit was shutdown for approximately 30 days of planned maintenance in the first quarter of 2005. Planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at the Port Reading facility is underway and expected to last for approximately 30 days. The Corporation’s liquidity and financial position have improved significantly since year-end 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Corporation’s debt was $5 billion and its debt to capitalization ratio was 54%. As of December 31, 2004, the Corporation’s debt has been reduced to $3.8 billion and the debt to capitalization ratio was 40.7%. Aggregate debt maturities through 2006 are $128 million. The Corporation’s cash balance at December 31, 2004 was $877 million. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in 2004, $1.4 billion in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002. Capital expenditures for 2005 are forecast to be $2.1 billion, with $2.0 billion dedicated to the exploration and production segment. This higher spending reflects the Corporation’s portfolio of organic growth projects and attractive investment opportunities. The Corporation has hedged approximately 60% of its 2005 worldwide crude oil production to underpin its cash flows to fund development projects. See further discussion on hedging starting on page 34. Consolidated Results of Operations Net income in 2004 was $977 million compared with net income of $643 million in 2003 and a net loss of $218 million in 2002, including impairments. Included in these amounts was income from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004, $169 million in 2003 and $27 million in 2002. See the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after-tax results by major operating activity for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are summarized below: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and production $ 755 $ 414 $ (102 ) Refining and marketing 451 327 85 Corporate (85 ) (101 ) (63 ) Interest expense (151 ) (173 ) (165 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 970 467 (245 ) Discontinued operations Net gains from asset sales — 116 — Income from operations 7 53 27 Income from cumulative effect of accounting change — 7 — Net income (loss) $ 977 $ 643 $ (218 ) Income (loss) per share from continuing operations — diluted $ 9.50 $ 5.17 $ (2.78 ) Net income (loss) per share — diluted $ 9.57 $ 7.11 $ (2.48 ) 18 Table of Contents In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in income from continuing operations for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Net gains from asset sales $ 54 $ 11 $ 100 Income tax adjustments 32 30 (43 ) Corporate insurance accrual (13 ) — — LIFO inventory liquidation 12 — — Accrued severance and office costs (9 ) (32 ) — Premiums on bond repurchases — (34 ) (6 ) Asset impairments — — (737 ) Reduction in carrying value of refining and marketing intangible assets and severance — — (22 ) $ 76 $ (25 ) $ (708 ) The items in the table above are explained on pages 21 through 24. The pre-tax amounts are shown on pages 21, 23 and 24. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production: After considering the exploration and production items in the preceding table, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas increased exploration and production revenues from continuing operations by approximately $400 million in 2004 compared with 2003. In 2003, the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately $170 million compared with 2002. The Corporation’s average selling prices from continuing operations, including the effects of hedging, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 27.42 $ 24.23 $ 24.04 Foreign 26.40 24.93 24.69 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 29.50 23.74 16.12 Foreign 30.02 24.09 19.09 Natural gas (per Mcf) United States 5.18 4.02 3.72 Foreign 3.94 3.01 2.26 19 Table of Contents The after-tax impacts of crude oil and U.S. natural gas hedges reduced earnings by $583 million ($935 million before income taxes) in 2004 and $260 million ($418 million before income taxes) in 2003 compared with an increase of $48 million ($82 million before income taxes) in 2002. The Corporation has after-tax, deferred hedge losses of $875 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2004. Of this amount, $680 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge positions. The remaining $195 million deferred loss is realized and relates to closed hedge positions. The deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings as the underlying barrels are sold in 2005. The Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its estimated worldwide crude oil production for 2005. The average price per barrel for open United States crude oil hedges is $33.06. The average price for open foreign crude oil hedges is $31.17. Approximately 20% of the Corporation’s hedges are WTI related and the remainder are Brent. In addition to the gains or losses on these open hedge positions, approximately $52 million of the $195 million deferred realized loss will reduce first quarter 2005 earnings and the remaining deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings over the balance of the year. The Corporation also has approximately 24,000 barrels per day of Brent related production hedged from 2006 to 2012. The average price of these hedge positions is $26.20 per barrel. There were no natural gas hedges outstanding at December 31, 2004. Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production, on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, was 342,000 barrels per day in 2004, 373,000 barrels per day in 2003 and 451,000 barrels per day in 2002. Approximately 50% of the production declines in 2004 and 2003 resulted from sales and exchanges of oil and gas producing properties. The remainder resulted principally from natural decline, and in 2003 compared with 2002, disappointing results from fields acquired in the United States in 2001 and reduced production from the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea. The Corporation anticipates that its 2005 production, including anticipated production from Libya, will be approximately 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. See page 27 for the current status of the discussions on the Corporation’s return to Libya. The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 44 44 54 Foreign 182 195 250 Total 226 239 304 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 12 11 12 Foreign 8 9 9 Total 20 20 21 Natural gas (thousands of Mcf per day) United States 171 253 373 Foreign 404 430 381 Total 575 683 754 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 342 373 451 Barrels of oil equivalent production included above related to discontinued operations — 13 51 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel). 20 Table of Contents Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue from continuing operations of approximately $75 million in 2004 compared with 2003 and lower revenue of approximately $425 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Operating costs and exploration expenses: Operating costs and exploration expenses from continuing operations decreased by approximately $115 million in 2004 compared with 2003 and increased by $70 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were lower in 2004 and 2003 principally reflecting decreased production volumes. Exploration expenses were lower in 2004 as a result of lower dry hole costs. Exploration expenses were higher in 2003, reflecting increased activity in the United States and Equatorial Guinea, as well as additional lease cost amortization. Production expenses increased in 2004 and 2003 primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar which increased costs incurred in foreign currencies. In addition, higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas increased the costs of production taxes, transportation, maintenance and fuel. Unit costs per barrel totaled $17.26 in 2004, $17.32 in 2003 and $15.11 in 2002. Unit cost per barrel includes production expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expense and administrative costs. Other: After-tax foreign currency gains amounted to $6 million ($29 million before income taxes) in 2004, compared with a loss of $22 million ($4 million before income taxes) in 2003 and income of $6 million ($26 million before income taxes) in 2002. Excluding items in the following table, the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in 2004 was 46%. This includes income taxes paid in jurisdictions with rates in excess of the United States statutory rate, such as the United Kingdom and Norway. It also reflects an income tax deduction for the Corporation’s hedging results at the U.S. statutory rate. Each of these factors increases the Corporation’s overall exploration and production effective income tax rate. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in 2005 is expected to be in the range of 45% to 49%. Assuming agreements are finalized and the Corporation returns to Libya, the exploration and production effective income tax rate will exceed the range above. Exploration and production earnings from continuing operations include the following items: After Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 54 $ 31 $ 34 Income tax adjustments 19 30 (43 ) Accrued severance and office costs (9 ) (32 ) — Asset impairments — — (737 ) $ 64 $ 29 $ (746 ) Before Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 55 $ 47 $ 41 Accrued severance and office costs (15 ) (53 ) — Asset impairments — — (1,024 ) $ 40 $ (6 ) $ (983 ) 21 Table of Contents 2004: The Corporation recognized gains on the sales of an office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non-producing property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation accrued an additional amount for severance and costs for vacated office space during 2004. Additional accruals for vacated office space of approximately $35 million before income taxes are anticipated in 2005. 2003: The Corporation recorded an after-tax charge of $32 million for accrued severance in the United States and United Kingdom and a reduction of leased office space in London. The pre-tax amount of this charge was $53 million, of which $32 million relates to vacated office space. The remainder of $21 million relates to severance for positions that were eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston. The Corporation recorded an income tax benefit reflecting the recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain prior year foreign exploration expenses. The gain from asset sale in 2003 reflects the sale of the Corporation’s 1.5% interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. 2002: Exploration and production earnings included after-tax asset impairments of $737 million, $530 million of which related to the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea. The pre-tax amount of the Ceiba Field impairment was $706 million. The charge resulted from a 12% reduction in the estimated total field reserves that will ultimately be produced from the field, as well as higher anticipated development costs needed to produce the remaining reserves at lower production rates over a longer period. The reduction in estimated recoverable reserves was attributable to disappointing 2002 year-end drilling results on the western flank of the field. The reduction in probable reserves and higher estimated future development costs resulted in an asset impairment because projected cash flows were less than the book value of the field, which includes allocated purchase price from the Triton acquisition. The Corporation also recorded an after-tax impairment charge of $207 million to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties located primarily in the Main Pass/ Breton Sound area of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of these properties were obtained in the 2001 LLOG acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas fields with proved and probable reserves and exploration acreage. This charge principally reflects reduced reserve estimates on these fields resulting from unfavorable production performance. The fair values of producing properties were determined by using discounted cash flows. Exploration properties were evaluated by using results of drilling and production data from nearby fields and seismic data for these and other properties in the area. During 2002, the United Kingdom government enacted a 10% supplementary tax on profits from oil and gas production. A one-time charge of $43 million was recorded to increase the existing United Kingdom deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. The gain on asset sales in 2002 reflected the disposal of oil and gas producing properties in the United States, United Kingdom and Azerbaijan, and the Corporation’s energy marketing business in the United Kingdom. The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes and changes in tax rates. Refining and Marketing: Earnings from refining and marketing activities amounted to $451 million in 2004, $327 million in 2003 and $85 million in 2002. The Corporation’s downstream operations include HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is accounted for using the equity method. Additional refining and marketing activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. In 2004, the Corporation invested in a 50% joint venture, Hess LNG L.L.C., to pursue investments in liquified natural gas terminals and related supply, trading and marketing opportunities. HOVENSA: The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $244 million in 2004, compared with income of $117 million in 2003 and a loss of $47 million in 2002. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were 22 Table of Contents due primarily to higher refining margins compared with prior years. HOVENSA’s total crude runs amounted to 484,000 barrels per day in 2004, 440,000 barrels per day in 2003 and 361,000 barrels per day in 2002. In late 2002 and early 2003, crude oil deliveries to HOVENSA were interrupted due to political disturbances in Venezuela. For the remainder of 2003 and in 2004, HOVENSA received contracted quantities of crude oil from PDVSA. The fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA operated at 139,000, 142,000 and 116,000 barrels per day in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The coking unit at HOVENSA commenced production in August 2002. The unit operated at the rate of 55,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 53,000 barrels per day in 2003. Planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was completed during the first quarter of 2005. Earnings from refining and marketing activities also include interest income on the note received from PDVSA at the formation of the joint venture. Interest on the PDVSA note amounted to $25 million in 2004, $30 million in 2003 and $35 million in 2002. Interest income is reflected in non-operating income in the income statement. In 2004, the Corporation recorded deferred income tax expense of $32 million in refining and marketing results relating to HOVENSA’s earnings and interest on the PDVSA note. In 2005, the Corporation expects that deferred income taxes will be recorded at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5%. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has approximately $190 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset its share of future HOVENSA taxable income. Retail, Energy Marketing and Other: Retail gasoline operations in 2004 were profitable but less so than in 2003, reflecting lower margins. Earnings from retail gasoline operations were higher in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting higher margins. Energy marketing earnings were lower in 2004 compared with 2003 because of lower margins. Energy marketing activities had higher earnings in 2003, reflecting increased margins and sales volumes in the early part of the year resulting from the cold winter. Results of the Port Reading refining facility improved in 2004 reflecting higher margins than in 2003, which was also an improvement over 2002 results. Total refined product sales volumes were 428,000 barrels per day in 2004, 419,000 barrels per day in 2003 and 383,000 barrels per day in 2002. Planned maintenance at the Port Reading fluid catalytic cracking unit is underway in the first quarter of 2005. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership amounted to income of $37 million in 2004, $17 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002. Before income taxes, the trading income was $72 million in 2004, $30 million in 2003 and $6 million in 2002. Marketing expenses increased in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting higher expenses from retail operations and the trading partnership. Refining and marketing earnings include the following items: After Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidation $ 12 $ — $ — Gain (loss) from asset sales — (20 ) 67 Reduction in carrying value of intangible assets — — (14 ) Severance accrual — — (8 ) $ 12 $ (20 ) $ 45 23 Table of Contents Before Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidation $ 20 $ — $ — Gain (loss) from asset sales — (9 ) 102 Reduction in carrying value of intangible assets — — (22 ) Severance accrual — — (13 ) $ 20 $ (9 ) $ 67 In 2004, refining and marketing results include income of $12 million from the liquidation of LIFO inventories. In 2003, refining and marketing earnings were reduced by a loss from the sale of the Corporation’s interest in a shipping joint venture. In 2002, the Corporation completed the sale of six United States flag vessels for $161 million in cash and a note for $29 million. The sale resulted in a net gain of $67 million. In connection with this sale, the Corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. At January 1, 2004, the charter support reserve was $32 million. During 2004, the Corporation made net payments of $4 million for charter support. Based on contractual long-term charters and estimates of future charter rates, the Corporation lowered the estimated charter support reserve by $18 million in 2004. The balance in this reserve at December 31, 2004 was $10 million. In 2002, the Corporation recorded a charge for the write-off of intangible assets in its U.S. energy marketing business. In addition, severance was recorded for cost reduction initiatives in refining and marketing, principally energy marketing. Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate: After-tax corporate expenses amounted to $85 million in 2004, $101 million in 2003 and $63 million in 2002. The 2004 corporate expenses include $13 million ($20 million before income taxes) of insurance costs related to retrospective premium increases. In addition, corporate results include an income tax benefit of $13 million from the settlement of a federal tax audit. The 2003 amount includes expenses of $34 million for premiums paid on the repurchase of bonds compared with $6 million in 2002. The pre-tax amounts of the bond repurchase premiums were $58 million in 2003 and $15 million in 2002 and are recorded in non-operating income (expense) in the income statement. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses for 2005 are estimated to be in the range of $90 to $100 million. Interest: After-tax interest expense in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 295 $ 334 $ 357 Less capitalized interest 54 41 101 Interest expense before income taxes 241 293 256 Less income taxes 90 120 91 After-tax interest expense $ 151 $ 173 $ 165 Interest incurred decreased in 2004 and 2003 reflecting lower average outstanding debt. After-tax interest expense in 2005 is anticipated to be lower than the 2004 level because of higher estimated capitalized interest. Discontinued Operations: In 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for an additional 25% interest in Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA). The exchange resulted 24 Table of Contents in an after-tax charge to income of $47 million ($51 million before income taxes). The after-tax loss on this exchange included a $43 million adjustment of the book value of the Colombian assets to fair value. The loss also included $17 million from the recognition in earnings of the value of related hedge contracts at the time of the exchange. These items were partially offset by after-tax earnings in Colombia prior to the exchange of $13 million. Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to the Colombian asset exchange. In 2003, the Corporation also sold Gulf of Mexico shelf properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom fields for $445 million. The after-tax gain from these asset sales of $176 million ($248 million before income taxes) was included in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations in 2003 also included $40 million of income from operations prior to the sales of these assets. Change in Accounting Principle: The Corporation adopted FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. A net after-tax gain of $7 million resulting from the cumulative effect of this accounting change was recorded at the beginning of 2003. At the date of adoption, a liability of $556 million representing the estimated fair value of the Corporation’s required dismantlement obligations was recorded on the balance sheet. In addition, a dismantlement asset of $311 million was recorded, as well as accumulated depreciation of $203 million. Sales and Other Operating Revenues: In 2004, sales and other operating revenues totaled $16,733 million, an increase of 17% compared with 2003. This increase principally reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined products, partially offset by decreased sales of purchased natural gas in energy marketing. Sales and other operating revenues increased by 24% in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting increased sales volumes and selling prices of refined products and the higher selling price of purchased natural gas in energy marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview: Cash flows from operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, totaled $1,903 million in 2004. During the year, the Corporation repaid $106 million of debt, which decreased its debt to capitalization ratio to 40.7% at December 31, 2004 from 42.5% at December 31, 2003. Total debt was $3,835 million at December 31, 2004 and $3,941 million at December 31, 2003. The Corporation has debt maturities of $128 million during the next two years. In 2004, the Corporation entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in 2009. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2004 totaled $877 million, an increase of $359 million for the year. Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, totaled $1,903 million in 2004, $1,581 million in 2003 and $1,965 million in 2002. The increased cash flows in 2004 resulted primarily from higher earnings and the timing of cash flows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities. In 2004, the Corporation also received a cash distribution of $88 million from HOVENSA. Lower cash flows in 2003 were primarily due to reduced exploration and production sales volumes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash flow by $230 million in 2004 and decreased cash flow by $120 million in 2003. 25 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures in 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and production Exploration $ 230 $ 196 $ 239 Production and development 1,204 1,067 1,095 Acquisitions — 23 70 1,434 1,286 1,404 Refining and marketing Operations 67 72 83 Acquisitions 20 — 47 87 72 130 Total $ 1,521 $ 1,358 $ 1,534 Proceeds from asset sales in 2004 totaled $57 million. In 2003, the Corporation sold certain producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia, several small United Kingdom fields and an interest in a shipping joint venture. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $545 million in 2003. In addition, the Corporation completed several asset exchanges. The Corporation swapped mature, high-cost assets in Colombia for an additional 25% interest in long-lived natural gas reserves in Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand, bringing the Corporation’s interest in the area to 50%. The Corporation exchanged its 25% equity investment in Premier Oil plc for a 23% interest in Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia, plus approximately $10 million in cash. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged 14% interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom for an additional 22.5% interest in the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico and $17 million in cash. This exchange increased the Corporation’s working interest in the Llano Field to 50% and decreased its interest in the Scott Field to 21% and the Telford Field to 17%. The net production from fields sold or exchanged in 2003 at the time of disposition was approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2002, the Corporation sold six United States Flag vessels, its energy marketing business in the United Kingdom and several small oil and gas fields for net proceeds of $412 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced debt by $106 million in 2004, $1,051 million in 2003 and $673 million in 2002. The debt reduction in 2004 was due to cash flow from operations. In 2003, debt was reduced by proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and from asset sales, as well as cash flow from operations. In 2003, the Corporation issued 13,500,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of $653 million. In 2004, the Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling $90 million. Dividends paid were $157 million in 2004, $108 million in 2003 and $107 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 was due to dividends on the 7% preferred stock issued in the fourth quarter of 2003. Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital expenditures in 2005 are expected to be approximately $2.1 billion, including an estimated amount for re-entering Libya. The Corporation anticipates that these expenditures will be funded by available cash and cash flow from operations, however, revolving credit facilities are available, if necessary. With higher crude oil prices, the Corporation’s collateral requirements under certain contracts with hedging and trading counterparties have increased. Outstanding letters of credit were $1,487 million at December 31, 2004, including $570 million drawn against the Corporation’s $2.5 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility, compared with outstanding letters of credit of $229 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has $1,930 million available under its committed revolving credit 26 Table of Contents agreement and has additional unused lines of credit of approximately $150 million, primarily for letters of credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue $825 million of additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an additional $5.5 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2004. At year end, the maximum amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from borrowings under the loan agreements is $2.0 billion. The Corporation’s aggregate maturities of long-term debt total $128 million over the next two years. Based on current estimates of production, capital expenditures and other factors, and assuming West Texas Intermediate oil prices average $35 per barrel and United States natural gas prices average $6 per Mcf, the Corporation anticipates it will fund its 2005 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends and required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand and cash flow from operations. If necessary, additional financing is available from its revolving credit facility and shelf registration. Libya: Prior to June 30, 1986, the Corporation had extensive exploration and production operations in Libya; however, U.S. government sanctions required suspension of participation in these operations. The Corporation wrote off the book value of its Libyan assets in connection with the cessation of operations. During 2004, the Corporation received U.S. government authorization to negotiate and execute an agreement with the government of Libya that would define the terms for resuming active participation in the Libyan properties. The U.S. Government has lifted most of the sanctions imposed on Libya and has rescinded the Libya portions of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1976. As a result, the Corporation and its partners will be able to resume operations in Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to ongoing commercial negotiations. Repatriation Provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004: On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) that effectively provides for a one-time reduction of the income tax rate to 5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. parent. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Corporation decided to repatriate approximately $1.3 billion of unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, the Corporation expects to record a tax provision of approximately $41 million in the first quarter of 2005. Had the additional taxes been recorded at the end of 2004, net income would have been $936 million ($9.93 per share basic and $9.17 per share diluted). The Corporation is reviewing the possibility of additional repatriations during 2005. The maximum additional amount that the Corporation could repatriate under the Act is approximately $600 million. The Corporation estimates that an additional tax provision of up to $32 million would be recorded, depending on the incremental amount distributed, if any. Credit Ratings: In 2004, two credit rating agencies downgraded their ratings of the Corporation’s debt. One of the revised ratings was below investment grade. If another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade, the Corporation would have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving credit facility. In addition, the incremental margin requirements with hedging and trading counterparties at December 31, 2004 would be approximately $23 million. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies: Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period 2006 and 2008 and Total 2005 2007 2009 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long-term debt $ 3,835 $ 50 $ 270 $ 467 $ 3,048 Operating leases 1,445 79 157 157 1,052 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 14,435 4,794 4,850 4,791 * Capital expenditures 1,374 932 409 33 — Operating expenses 426 220 131 69 6 Other long-term liabilities 199 58 72 36 33 * The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Current purchases amount to approximately $2.4 billion annually. 27 Table of Contents In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. Also included are normal term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year-end market prices. The table also reflects that portion of the Corporation’s planned capital expenditures that are contractually committed at December 31. The Corporation’s 2005 capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $2.1 billion. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, including minimum pension plan funding requirements. In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the Corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. The balance in the charter support reserve at December 31, 2004 was $10 million. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining 50% interest in a retail marketing and gasoline station joint venture for approximately $90 million. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2004 amounted to $97 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. At December 31, the Corporation has $1,415 million of letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 72 Guarantees 237 * $ 309 * Includes $40 million HOVENSA debt and $97 million crude oil purchase guarantees discussed above. The remainder relates principally to loan guarantees — $55 million for a natural gas pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 5% interest and $45 million for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged lease financings not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these financings is $467 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $462 million at December 31, 2003. The Corporation’s December 31, 2004 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 40.7% to 43.5% if the lease financings were included as debt. See also “Contractual Obligations and Contingencies” above, Note 5, “Refining Joint Venture,” and Note 16, “Guarantees and Contingencies,” in the financial statements. 28 Table of Contents Foreign Operations: The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities in many foreign countries, including the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Malaysia and Equatorial Guinea. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency risk. The effects of these events are accounted for when they occur and generally have not been material to the Corporation’s liquidity or financial position. HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a refinery in the Virgin Islands. Although there have in the past been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations, these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial position. The Corporation also has a note receivable of $273 million at December 31, 2004 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. The Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. In an area requiring a major capital expenditure before production can begin, an exploration well is carried as an asset if sufficient reserves are discovered to justify its completion as a production well, and additional exploration drilling is underway or firmly planned. The Corporation does not capitalize the cost of other exploratory wells for more than one year unless proved reserves are found. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, undeveloped leasehold impairments and the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties, wells and equipment. Reductions in reserve estimates may result in the need for increased depreciation or impairments of proved properties and related assets. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with FAS No. 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve 29 Table of Contents determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by D&M. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the timing of future production, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. In 2002, the Corporation recorded impairments of the Ceiba Field and LLOG properties that were required primarily because of reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes and, in the case of Ceiba, anticipated additional development costs. The impairment charges did not result from changes in the other factors. The change in the estimated timing of production on the Ceiba Field did not significantly affect the undiscounted future cash flows, but did significantly reduce the fair value of the field determined by discounted cash flows. The Corporation could have additional impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments. The Corporation recorded $977 million of goodwill in connection with the purchase of Triton Energy Limited in 2001. Factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill included the strategic value of expanding global operations to access new growth areas outside of the United States and the North Sea, obtaining critical mass in Africa and Southeast Asia, and synergies, including cost savings, improved processes and portfolio high grading opportunities. In accordance with FAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested for impairment annually. FAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. An operating segment shall be deemed a reporting unit if all of its components are economically similar. Within the Corporation’s exploration and production operating segment there are currently two components: (1) Americas and West Africa and (2) Europe, North Africa and Asia. Each component has a manager who reports to the segment manager. The Corporation has determined the components have similar economic characteristics and, therefore, has aggregated the components into a single reporting unit — the exploration and production operating segment. As a result, goodwill has been assigned to the exploration and production operating segment. If the Corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such 30 Table of Contents that there was more than one operating segment, or its components were no longer economically similar, goodwill would be assigned to two or more reporting units. The goodwill would be allocated to any new reporting units using a relative fair value approach in accordance with FAS No. 142. Goodwill impairment testing for lower level reporting units could result in the recognition of an impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. The Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of the exploration and production segment as a whole and it evaluated the following characteristics in determining that the components are economically similar: • The Corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single, global business. • Each component produces oil and gas. • The exploration and production processes are similar in each component. • The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar. • Customers of each component are similar. • The components share resources and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and a shared services organization. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the expected risked present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies. The determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. In addition, changes in management structure or sales or dispositions of a portion of the exploration and production segment may result in goodwill impairment. Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the $977 million of goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment. In 2002, the Corporation recognized asset impairments because reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes caused the expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets to be lower than the asset carrying amounts. No impairment of goodwill existed because the fair value of the overall exploration and production operating segment continued to exceed its recorded book value. Segments: The Corporation has two operating segments, exploration and production, and refining and marketing. Management has determined that these are its operating segments because, in accordance with FAS No. 131, these are the segments of the Corporation (i) that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, is the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for performing the functions within the Corporation of allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, the Corporation’s operating segments. The CODM uses only the operating results of each segment as a whole to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess the segment performance. The CODM manages each segment globally and does not regularly review the operating results of any component (e.g., geographic area) or asset within each 31 Table of Contents segment or any such information by geographical location, oil and gas property or project, subsidiary or division, to make decisions about resources to be allocated or to assess performance. While the CODM does review and approve initial corporate funding for a new project using information about the project, he does not review subsequent operating results by project after the initial funding. Each operating segment has one manager. The segment managers are responsible for allocating resources within the segments, reviewing financial results of components within the segments, and assessing the performance of the components. The CODM evaluates the performance of the segment managers based on performance metrics related to each manager’s operating segment as a whole. The Board of Directors of the Corporation does not receive more detailed information than that used by the CODM to operate and manage the Corporation. Hedging: The Corporation may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and refined product selling prices. Related hedge gains or losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices. Generally, these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), and the changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These transactions meet the requirements for hedge accounting, including correlation. The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective portion of hedges is included in current earnings. The Corporation’s remaining derivatives, including foreign currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change in fair value is included in income currently. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has $875 million of deferred exploration and production hedging losses, after income taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are based on international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS performance. Improved performance may increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. While overall governance is the responsibility of senior management, the Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally meet corporate EHS goals. The Port Reading refining facility and the HOVENSA refinery manufacture conventional and reformulated gasolines that are cleaner burning than that required under current U.S. regulations. The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures to reduce sulfur content in recent years. In 2004, new regulations went into effect that significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional rules to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel will go into effect in 2006. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional large capital expenditures. 32 Table of Contents The Corporation and HOVENSA continue to evaluate options to determine the most cost effective compliance strategies for known fuel regulations. Estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading are approximately $70 million over the next two years. Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be approximately $400 million in total, $50 million of which has already been spent. Remaining capital expenditures are projected to be $350 million over the next two years. HOVENSA plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. If it becomes necessary to finance a portion of the capital expenditures, HOVENSA has $400 million of available revolving credit capacity. Federal legislation to restrict or ban the use of MTBE, a gasoline oxygenate, and to require the use of ‘renewable’ fuels was considered by the United States Congress in 2004 and will likely be reconsidered in 2005. The Corporation and HOVENSA both manufacture and use MTBE, where permitted, to meet the federal requirement for oxygen in reformulated gasoline. In states within the Corporation’s marketing area where MTBE bans have been enacted, such as Connecticut and New York, the Corporation markets reformulated gasoline without oxygenates and ethanol is added to the gasoline downstream from the refineries to meet regulatory requirements. If Congress bans MTBE nationally or if additional state bans take effect, or if an obligation to use ethanol or other renewable fuels is imposed, the effect on the Corporation and HOVENSA could be significant. Whether the effect is significant will depend on several factors, including the extent and timing of any such bans of MTBE or obligations to use ethanol, requirements for maintenance of certain air emission reductions if MTBE is banned, the cost and availability of alternative oxygenates or credits and whether the minimum oxygen content standard for reformulated gasoline remains in effect. The Corporation will continue to review various options to market and produce reformulated gasolines if additional MTBE bans take effect. As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in 2003, the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 50% of the nation’s refining capacity in 26 states and negotiations continue with many refiners. Depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience increased capital and operating expenses related to air emissions controls. The PRI allows for controls to be phased in over several years. The Corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the environmental and social impact of air emissions. On a global scale, climate change is an issue that has prompted much public debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and development. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,” including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this program may be significant, not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the Corporation’s entire greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2004, the Corporation’s reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately $81 million. The Corporation does not discount its environmental liability. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Remediation spending was $12 million in 2004 and 2003 and $9 million in 2002. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, were $1 million in 2004, $7 million in 2003 and $5 million in 2002. 33 Table of Contents Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value-at-risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity linked securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The forward purchase and sale of commodities is performed as part of the Corporation’s normal activities. At title date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date. • Futures: The Corporation uses exchange traded futures contracts on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and are subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. 34 Table of Contents • Energy Commodity Linked Securities: Securities where the price is linked to the price of an underlying energy commodity. These securities may be issued by a company or government. Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The potential change in fair value based on commodity price risk is presented in the non-trading and trading sections below. For foreign exchange rate risk, the impact of a 10% change in foreign exchange rates on the value of the Corporation’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts is presented in the non-trading section. Similarly, the impact of a 15% change in interest rates on the fair value of the Corporation’s debt is also presented in the non-trading section. A 10% change in foreign exchange rates and a 15% change in the rate of interest over one year are considered reasonable possibilities for providing sensitivity disclosures. Non-Trading: The Corporation’s non-trading activities include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporation’s selling prices. As of December 31, the Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its estimated 2005 worldwide crude oil production. The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) related open hedge positions is $33.06. The average price for Brent crude oil related open hedge positions is $31.17. Approximately 20% of the Corporation’s hedges is WTI related and the remainder is Brent. In addition, the Corporation has approximately 24,000 barrels per day of Brent related crude oil production hedged from 2006 through 2012 at an average price of $26.20 per barrel. There were no hedges of natural gas production at year end. As market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages. Because the selling price of crude oil has increased during 2004, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2004 includes after-tax deferred losses of $875 million ($195 million of realized losses and $680 million of unrealized losses) related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales. Realized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on closed contracts that are deferred until the underlying barrels are sold. In addition to the impact of the open hedge positions described above, approximately $52 million of the realized losses will reduce earnings in the first quarter of 2005 and the remainder will reduce earnings during the balance of 2005. The pre-tax amount of all deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of commodities to be sold under fixed-price sales contracts. The following table summarizes the value-at-risk results of commodity related derivatives that are settled in cash and used in non-trading activities. The results may vary from time to time as hedge levels change. Non-Trading Activities (Millions of dollars) 2004 At December 31 $ 108 Average for the year 90 High during the year 111 Low during the year 52 2003 At December 31 $ 44 Average for the year 43 High during the year 47 Low during the year 40 35 Table of Contents The increase in the value at risk in 2004 principally reflects additional hedge positions on Brent related production for the years 2006 through 2012. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has $476 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2005 ($384 million at December 31, 2003). The fair value of foreign exchange contracts recorded as assets was $49 million at December 31, 2004 ($40 million at December 31, 2003). The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is estimated to be $53 million at December 31, 2004 ($43 million at December 31, 2003). At December 31, 2004, the interest rate on substantially all of the Corporation’s debt was fixed and there were no interest rate swaps. The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,835 million has a fair value of $4,327 million at December 31, 2004 (debt of $3,941 million at December 31, 2003 had a fair value of $4,440 million). A 15% change in the rate of interest would change the fair value of debt by approximately $260 million at December 31, 2004 and by approximately $270 million at December 31, 2003. Trading: The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. These strategies include proprietary position management and trading to enhance the potential return on assets. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts. In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices, primarily in North America and Europe. Trading positions include futures, forwards, swaps and options. In some cases, physical purchase and sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the trading results. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market and are reflected in income currently. Total realized gains for the year amounted to $79 million. The following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100% of the trading partnership and other trading activities. 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year $ 67 $ 36 Change in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year and still outstanding at the end of year 13 36 Reversal of fair value for contracts closed during the year (10 ) (26 ) Fair value of contracts entered into during the year and still outstanding 114 21 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the year $ 184 $ 67 The Corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The Corporation’s risk management department 36 Table of Contents regularly compares valuations to independent sources and models.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer By /s/ John B. Hess John B. Hess Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer February 21, 2005 39 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Amerada Hess Corporation We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amerada Hess Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management’s assessment that Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of consolidated income, retained earnings, cash flows, changes in preferred stock, common stock and capital in excess of par value and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated February 21, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on these statements.

4447,HES,HESS CORP,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, exploration and production (E&P) and marketing and refining. The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The marketing and refining segment manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum products and other energy products. Exploration & Production The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporation has increased its reserve life in each of the last three years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,093 million and 1,046 million barrels of oil equivalent. The following table summarizes the components of proved reserves as of December 31: 2005 2004 Crude oil and condensate (millions of barrels) U.S. 124 18 % 124 19 % International 568 82 522 81 Total 692 100 % 646 100 % Natural Gas (millions of Mcf) U.S. 282 12 % 300 12 % International 2,124 88 2,100 88 Total 2,406 100 % 2,400 100 % Income from continuing operations was $1,058 million in 2005, $755 million in 2004 and $414 million in 2003. The improved results were primarily driven by increasingly higher oil and gas prices during the reporting period. See further discussion in Comparison of Results on page 21. Production totaled 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2005, 342,000 boepd in 2004 and 373,000 boepd in 2003. During 2005, first production was achieved from Block A-18 of the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), the Clair field in the North Sea and Phase 1 of the ACG fields in Azerbaijan. Damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the Gulf of Mexico caused production to be lower by 7,000 boepd in 2005. The Corporation estimates that production will be approximately 360,000 boepd to 380,000 boepd in 2006. The Corporation has a number of development projects that are in various stages of completion that should begin production in 2006 and 2007. Development milestones achieved in 2005 include: • Development of the Atlantic and Cromarty natural gas fields in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea is substantially complete. • The Phu Horm onshore gas project in Thailand was sanctioned. First production is scheduled at the end of 2006. • The Okume Complex development in Equatorial Guinea is on schedule and on budget. First production of crude oil is scheduled for the beginning of 2007. • Development of the Pangkah field in Indonesia also progressed and is on schedule. First gas is expected in the first half of 2007. During 2005, the Corporation acquired a controlling interest in a corporate joint venture operating in the Volga-Urals region of Russia. Subsequent to the acquisition, this venture acquired additional licenses and 18 Table of Contents assets, bringing the Corporation’s total investment in Russia to approximately $400 million. Production averaged 6,000 boepd in 2005 and is expected to average 12,000 to 15,000 boepd in 2006. In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners, re-entered its former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. The re-entry terms include a 25-year extension of the concessions, in which the Corporation will hold an 8.16% interest, and a payment by the Corporation to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $260 million. In addition, the Corporation will make a payment of $106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets made since 1986. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2006 production from Libya will average approximately 20,000 to 25,000 boepd. In January 2006, the Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation has a 25-year development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration opportunities. In 2006, the Corporation will complete the sale of its interests in certain producing properties located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico for $404 million, before purchase price adjustments. The Corporation estimates that it will record an after-tax gain of $160 to $180 million in the first quarter on the sale of these assets. Marketing & Refining The Corporation’s strategy is to deliver consistent financial performance from marketing and refining assets and generate free cash flow. Net income was $515 million in 2005, $451 million in 2004 and $327 million in 2003. Refining operations contributed net income of $346 million in 2005, $302 million in 2004 and $165 million in 2003. Marketing earnings were $136 million in 2005, $112 million in 2004 and $145 million in 2003. Total marketing and refining earnings improved due to increased margins and higher refined product sales volumes. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA totaling $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004. In 2005, the Corporation’s Port Reading facility commenced its approximately $75 million program for complying with low-sulfur gasoline requirements. Capital expenditures of $23 million were made in 2005 with the remainder of the expenditures anticipated in 2006. Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are expected to approximate $410 million, of which $160 million has been spent. Anticipated capital expenditures in 2006 for the low-sulfur requirements are $200 million. HOVENSA plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,840 million in 2005 compared with $1,903 million in 2004. At December 31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $315 million compared with $877 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2005 was 37.6% compared with 40.7% at the end of 2004. Total debt was $3,785 million at December 31, 2005 and $3,835 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporation has debt maturities of $26 million in 2006. 19 Table of Contents Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 353 $ 446 International 2,031 1,117 Total Exploration and Production 2,384 1,563 Marketing and Refining 106 87 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 2,490 $ 1,650 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 89 $ 89 International 60 40 $ 149 $ 129 The Corporation has approved a $4 billion capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2006, which includes a total of approximately $780 million for the acquisition of Egyptian assets and re-entry to the Waha concessions in Libya. Excluding acquisitions, $3.1 billion is targeted for Exploration and Production and $125 million for Marketing and Refining. Consolidated Results of Operations Net income from continuing operations in 2005 was $1,242 million compared with $970 million in 2004 and $467 million in 2003. See the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after-tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,058 $ 755 $ 414 Marketing and Refining 515 451 327 Corporate (191 ) (85 ) (101 ) Interest expense (140 ) (151 ) (173 ) Income from continuing operations 1,242 970 467 Discontinued operations — 7 169 Income from cumulative effect of accounting change — — 7 Net income $ 1,242 $ 977 $ 643 Income per share from continuing operations — diluted $ 11.94 $ 9.50 $ 5.17 Net income per share — diluted $ 11.94 $ 9.57 $ 7.11 In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. 20 Table of Contents The following items of income (expense), on an after-tax basis, are included in income from continuing operations: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Net gains from asset sales $ 41 $ 54 $ 31 Hurricane related costs (26 ) — — Income tax adjustments 11 19 30 Legal settlement 11 — — Accrued severance and office costs — (9 ) (32 ) Marketing and Refining LIFO inventory liquidation 32 12 — Charge related to customer bankruptcy (8 ) — — Net loss from asset sales — — (20 ) Corporate Premiums on bond repurchases (26 ) — (34 ) Tax on repatriated earnings (72 ) — — Income tax adjustments — 13 — Insurance accrual — (13 ) — $ (37 ) $ 76 $ (25 ) The items in the table above are explained, and the pre-tax amounts are shown, on pages 24 through 26. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s exploration and production operations: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues $ 4,210 $ 3,416 $ 3,087 Non-operating income 94 90 21 Total revenues 4,304 3,506 3,108 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,007 825 796 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 397 287 369 General, administrative and other expenses 140 150 168 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 965 918 998 Total costs and expenses 2,509 2,180 2,331 Results of operations from continuing operations before income taxes 1,795 1,326 777 Provision for income taxes 737 571 363 Results from continuing operations 1,058 755 414 Discontinued operations — 7 170 Income from cumulative effect of accounting change — — 7 Results of operations $ 1,058 $ 762 $ 591 21 Table of Contents After considering the exploration and production items in the table on page 24, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas increased exploration and production revenues from continuing operations by approximately $870 million, including the effect of hedging, in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2004, the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately $400 million compared with 2003. The Corporation’s average selling prices, including the effects of hedging, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 32.64 $ 27.42 $ 24.23 Europe 33.13 26.18 24.66 Africa 32.10 26.35 25.43 Asia and other 54.69 38.36 28.49 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 38.50 29.50 23.74 Europe 37.13 27.44 23.09 Natural gas (per Mcf) United States 7.93 5.18 4.02 Europe 5.29 3.96 3.00 Asia and other 4.02 3.90 3.10 The Corporation’s average selling prices, excluding the effects of hedging, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 51.16 $ 38.56 $ 29.43 Europe 52.22 37.57 29.06 Africa 51.70 37.07 28.10 Asia and other 54.69 38.36 28.49 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 38.50 29.50 23.74 Europe 37.13 27.44 23.09 Natural gas (per Mcf) United States 7.93 5.53 5.08 Europe 5.29 3.96 3.00 Asia and other 4.02 3.90 3.10 The after-tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by $989 million ($1,582 million before income taxes) in 2005, $583 million ($935 million before income taxes) in 2004 and $260 million ($418 million before income taxes) in 2003. Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 335,000 boepd in 2005, 342,000 boepd in 2004 and 373,000 boepd in 2003. Hurricane related interruptions in the Gulf of Mexico reduced 2005 production by approximately 7,000 boepd. The Corporation anticipates that 22 Table of Contents its 2006 production will average between 360,000 and 380,000 boepd, including 20,000 to 25,000 boepd from Libya. The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 44 44 44 Europe 110 119 137 Africa 67 61 52 Asia and other 7 4 8 Total 228 228 241 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 12 12 11 Europe 4 6 7 Total 16 18 18 Natural gas (thousands of Mcf per day) United States 137 171 253 Europe 274 319 367 Asia and other 133 85 63 Total 544 575 683 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 335 342 373 Barrels of oil equivalent production included above related to discontinued operations — — 13 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel). Crude oil production in the United States in 2005 included increased production from the Llano field which offset natural decline and the effect of the hurricanes. Production in Europe was lower due to natural decline and increased maintenance, partially offset by new production from Russia. Increased crude oil production in Africa is principally due to improved performance from the Ceiba field in Equatorial Guinea. Natural gas production in Asia increased due to new production from the JDA. Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue of approximately $80 million in 2005 and $75 million in 2004. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $147 million in 2005 and $44 million in 2004 compared with the prior years, excluding the hurricane related costs and accrued severance and office lease costs discussed on page 24. Production expenses increased in 2005 and 2004, principally reflecting higher maintenance expenses, production taxes and fuel costs. Production expenses in 2005 also increased due to expanded operations in Russia and the JDA. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2005, principally due to higher per barrel rates. Depreciation and related charges were lower in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting decreased production volumes. Unit production costs per barrel of oil equivalent, comprised of production expense, administrative costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization totaled $16.88 in 2005, $14.96 in 2004 and $14.52 in 2003. Unit production costs in 2006 are estimated to be $17 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses were higher in 2005, reflecting increased drilling and seismic activity compared with 2004. Exploration expenses were lower in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower dry hole costs. 23 Table of Contents Other: After-tax foreign currency gains were $20 million ($3 million loss before income taxes) in 2005 and $6 million ($29 million before income taxes) in 2004, compared with a loss of $22 million ($4 million before income taxes) in 2003. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was 41% in 2005, 43% in 2004 and 47% in 2003. After considering the items in the table below, the effective income tax rates were 42% in 2005, 46% in 2004 and 51% in 2003. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in 2006 is expected to be in the range of 50% to 52%. The increase in the estimated 2006 effective income tax rate is due to an anticipated additional 10% supplementary tax on oil and gas earnings in the United Kingdom, and the estimated impact of Libyan operations, which commenced in 2006 and will be taxed at a rate higher than the current exploration and production effective rate. In addition, there will also be a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $40 to $50 million from the adjustment of deferred income tax liabilities when the anticipated United Kingdom tax is enacted, which is expected to be in the second or third quarter of 2006. Reported exploration and production earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 48 $ 55 $ 47 $ 41 $ 54 $ 31 Hurricane related costs (40 ) — — (26 ) — — Income tax adjustments — — — 11 19 30 Legal settlement 19 — — 11 — — Accrued severance and office costs — (15 ) (53 ) — (9 ) (32 ) $ 27 $ 40 $ (6 ) $ 37 $ 64 $ 29 2005: The gains from asset sales in 2005 represent the disposal of non-producing properties in the United Kingdom and the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased interest in the Pangkah natural gas development in Indonesia. The Corporation incurred incremental expenses, principally repair costs and higher insurance premiums in 2005, as a result of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico that are included in production expenses in the income statement. The income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale, which is reflected in non-operating income in the income statement. 2004: The Corporation recognized gains on the sales of an office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non-producing property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation accrued an additional amount for severance and vacated office space during 2004, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the income statement. 2003: The Corporation recorded an after-tax charge for accrued severance in the United States and United Kingdom and a reduction of leased office space in London. The pre-tax amount of this charge was $53 million, of which $32 million relates to vacated office space. The remainder of $21 million relates to severance for positions that were eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston. These expenses are reflected principally in general and administrative expenses in the income statement. The Corporation recorded an income tax benefit reflecting the recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain prior year foreign exploration expenses. The gain from asset sale in 2003 reflects the sale of the Corporation’s 1.5% interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses and changes in tax rates. 24 Table of Contents Marketing and Refining Earnings from marketing and refining activities amounted to $515 million in 2005, $451 million in 2004 and $327 million in 2003. After considering the marketing and refining items in the table on page 26, the earnings amounted to $491 million in 2005, $439 million in 2004 and $347 million in 2003 and are discussed in the paragraphs below. The Corporation’s downstream operations include HOVENSA, a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is accounted for using the equity method. Additional marketing and refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on the note receivable from PDVSA and other miscellaneous items were $346 million in 2005, $302 million in 2004 and $165 million in 2003. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $376 million ($231 million after income taxes) in 2005 and $244 million ($216 million after income taxes) in 2004. In 2003, HOVENSA’s earnings were $117 million, before and after income taxes. The increased earnings in 2005 were due to higher refining margins. In 2005, the Corporation provided income taxes at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5% on HOVENSA’s income and the interest income on the PDVSA note. In 2004, income taxes on HOVENSA’s earnings were partially offset by available loss carryforwards. Cash distributions from HOVENSA were $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004. A crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance in 2005. Pre-tax interest on the PDVSA note was $20 million, $25 million and $30 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest income is reflected in non-operating income in the income statement. At December 31, 2005, the remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $212 million, which is scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009. Port Reading’s after-tax earnings were $100 million in 2005, $60 million in 2004 and $27 million in 2003, reflecting higher margins in each period. In 2005, the Port Reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Utilization Refinery Capacity 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 92.2% * 96.7% 88.0% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 81.9% * 92.9% 94.7% Coker 58 92.8% 94.5% 91.4% Port Reading 65 85.3% * 83.4% ** 87.1% * Reflects reduced utilization from scheduled maintenance. ** Includes a storm-related interruption. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $112 million in 2005, $100 million in 2004 and $165 million in 2003, excluding the income from liquidation of LIFO inventories and other items described on page 26. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher margins and increased sales volumes. The decrease in 2004 was principally due to lower margins. Total refined product sales volumes were 456,000 barrels per day in 2005, 428,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 419,000 barrels per day in 2003. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership amounted 25 Table of Contents to income of $33 million in 2005, $37 million in 2004 and $17 million in 2003. Before income taxes, the trading income amounted to $60 million in 2005, $72 million in 2004 and $30 million in 2003, which is included in operating revenues in the income statement. Marketing expenses increased in 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflecting additional retail sites and higher costs of the trading partnership. Reported marketing and refining earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidation $ 51 $ 20 $ — $ 32 $ 12 $ — Loss from asset sales — — (9 ) — — (20 ) Charge related to customer bankruptcy (13 ) — — (8 ) — — $ 38 $ 20 $ (9 ) $ 24 $ 12 $ (20 ) In 2005, marketing and refining earnings include income from the liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories and a charge resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the utility industry, which is included in marketing expenses. In 2004, marketing and refining results include income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories. In 2003, marketing and refining earnings were reduced by a loss from the sale of the Corporation’s interest in a shipping joint venture. Marketing and refining earnings will likely continue to be volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions, government regulatory changes and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding the other items, after-tax listed below) $ 119 $ 116 $ 98 Income taxes (benefits) on the above (26 ) (31 ) (31 ) 93 85 67 Other items, after-tax Tax on repatriation of foreign earnings 72 — — Premiums on bond repurchases 26 — 34 Corporate insurance accrual — 13 — Adjustments relating to income tax audits — (13 ) — Net corporate expenses $ 191 $ 85 $ 101 The American Jobs Creation Act provided for a one-time reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. parent. During 2005, the Corporation repatriated $1.9 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the recognition of an income tax provision of $72 million. The pre-tax amounts of the bond repurchase premiums in 2005 and 2003 were $39 million and $58 million, respectively, which are reflected in non-operating income in the income statement. The pre-tax amount of the 2004 corporate insurance accrual was $20 million. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses in 2006 are estimated to be in the range of $105 to $115 million. 26 Table of Contents Interest After-tax interest expense was as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 304 $ 295 $ 334 Less capitalized interest 80 54 41 Interest expense before income taxes 224 241 293 Less income taxes 84 90 120 After-tax interest expense $ 140 $ 151 $ 173 After-tax interest expense in 2006 is anticipated to be lower than the 2005 level because of higher estimated capitalized interest. Discontinued Operations In 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing properties in Colombia plus $10 million in cash, for an additional 25% interest in natural gas reserves in the JDA. In addition, the Corporation sold, for aggregate proceeds of $445 million, producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, the Jabung field in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom fields. These disposals resulted in a net gain from asset sales of $116 million and income from operations prior to sale was $53 million, after income taxes. Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to the exchanged Colombian assets. Change in Accounting Principle The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. A net after-tax gain of $7 million resulting from the cumulative effect of this accounting change was recorded at the beginning of 2003. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $22,747 million in 2005, an increase of 36% compared with 2004. The increase reflects higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas in exploration and production activities and higher selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. In 2004, sales and other operating revenues totaled $16,733 million, an increase of 17% compared with 2003. This increase principally reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined products, partially offset by decreased sales of purchased natural gas in marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas. 27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars, except ratios) Cash and cash equivalents $ 315 $ 877 Current portion of long-term debt $ 26 $ 50 Total debt $ 3,785 $ 3,835 Stockholders’ equity $ 6,286 $ 5,597 Debt to capitalization ratio* 37.6 % 40.7 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus stockholders’ equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,840 $ 1,903 $ 1,581 Investing activities (2,255 ) (1,371 ) (777 ) Financing activities (147 ) (173 ) (483 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (562 ) $ 359 $ 321 Operating Activities: In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities of $1,840 million was comparable to the prior year as higher earnings in 2005 were offset by a decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally working capital, of $408 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,903 million in 2004, an increase of $322 million over 2003, resulting primarily from higher earnings and an increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $227 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,581 million in 2003. The Corporation received cash distributions of $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004 from HOVENSA. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and production Exploration $ 229 $ 168 $ 180 Production and development 1,598 1,204 1,067 Acquisitions (including leasehold) 408 62 39 2,235 1,434 1,286 Marketing and refining Operations 106 67 72 Acquisitions — 20 — 106 87 72 Total $ 2,341 $ 1,521 $ 1,358 28 Table of Contents Proceeds from asset sales in 2005 and 2004 were $74 million and $57 million, respectively, principally from the sale of non-producing properties. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $545 million in 2003. Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced debt by $50 million in 2005, $106 million in 2004 and $1,051 million in 2003. In 2005, bond repurchases of $600 million were funded by borrowings on the revolving credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States. The net reduction in debt in 2005 and 2004 was funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. In 2003, debt was reduced by proceeds of $653 million from the issuance of 13,500,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock and from asset sales, as well as cash flow from operations. In 2005 and 2004, the Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling $62 million and $90 million, respectively. Dividends paid were $159 million in 2005, $157 million in 2004 and $108 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was due to dividends on the 7% preferred stock issued in the fourth quarter of 2003. Future Capital Requirements and Resources: In January 2006, the Corporation announced a $4 billion capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2006, which includes approximately $780 million for the acquisition of Egyptian assets and payments for the Corporation’s re-entry into Libya. Excluding acquisitions, $3.1 billion relates to exploration and production, including $1,370 million for development, $1,130 million for production and $570 million for exploration. The program also includes $125 million for marketing and refining. The Corporation’s aggregate maturities of long-term debt total $54 million over the next two years. The Corporation anticipates it will fund its 2006 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand and cash flow from operations and, as necessary, additional borrowings on the revolving credit facility. Outstanding letters of credit, principally relating to hedging activities at December 31, were as follows: 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Lines of Credit Revolving credit facility $ 28 $ 570 Committed short-term letter of credit facilities 1,675 — Uncommitted lines 982 917 $ 2,685 $ 1,487 At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has $1,872 million available under its $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility and has additional unused lines of credit of approximately $370 million, primarily for letters of credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. A loan agreement covenant allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $6.7 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2005. At year end, the maximum amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from borrowings under this covenant is $2.5 billion. Credit Ratings: Two credit rating agencies have rated the Corporation’s debt as investment grade and one rating agency’s rating is below investment grade. If another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade, the Corporation would have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving credit facility. In addition, margin requirements with non-trading and trading counterparties at December 31, 2005 would increase by approximately $30 million. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies: Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2005: Payments Due by Period 2007 and 2009 and Total 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long-term debt* $ 3,785 $ 26 $ 58 $ 775 $ 2,926 Operating leases 2,384 345 719 283 1,037 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 29,070 9,905 9,961 9,204 ** Capital expenditures 1,729 1,191 523 15 — Operating expenses 470 319 119 27 5 Other long-term liabilities 306 72 91 78 65 * At December 31, 2005, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.0%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $4.6 billion annually using year-end 2005 prices. In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year-end market prices. The table also reflects that portion of the Corporation’s planned $4 billion capital expenditure program that is contractually committed at December 31. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, including minimum pension plan funding requirements. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation had an accrual of $39 million for vacated office costs in London. During 2005, $8 million of payments were made reducing the accrual to $31 million at December 31, 2005. Additional accruals totaling approximately $30 million, before income taxes, are anticipated in 2006 for office space to be vacated. In December 2005, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) issued an order to the Corporation to pay royalties on certain deep water exploration leases in the Gulf of Mexico held by the Corporation. In the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (the Act), Congress granted royalty relief in order to encourage deep water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. With respect to exploration leases issued between November 28, 1995 and November 28, 2000, the Act granted royalty relief without regard to the market price of crude oil and natural gas at the time the royalty is payable. However, in regulations promulgated by MMS relating to these deep water leases, the MMS imposed a price threshold such that if the market price for crude oil or natural gas exceeded the threshold, royalty relief would not be granted. The Corporation has accrued $34 million for royalties relating to sales from these leases, which the Corporation believes is its full potential liability if the MMS regulations are determined to be valid. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in a retail marketing and gasoline station joint venture for approximately $140 million. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2005 amounted to $135 million. In addition, the 30 Table of Contents Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. At December 31, the Corporation has $2,612 million of letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 73 Guarantees 233 * $ 306 * Includes $40 million HOVENSA debt and $135 million crude oil purchase guarantees discussed above. The remainder relates to a loan guarantee of $58 million for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $480 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $467 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporation’s December 31, 2005 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 37.6% to 40.4% if these leases were included as debt. See also “Contractual Obligations and Contingencies” above, note 5, “Refining Joint Venture,” and note 16, “Guarantees and Contingencies,” in the financial statements. Foreign Operations: The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities in the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Russia, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Gabon, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Libya and other countries. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency risk. HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a refinery in the Virgin Islands. In the past, there have been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations, however, these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial position. The Corporation has a note receivable of $212 million at December 31, 2005 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. All payments are current and the Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance. Subsequent Events In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners, re-entered its former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. The re-entry terms include a 25-year extension of the concessions, in which the Corporation will hold an 8.16% interest, and a payment by the Corporation to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $260 million. In addition, the Corporation will make a payment of $106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets made since 1986. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2006 production from Libya will average approximately 20,000 to 25,000 boepd. In January 2006, the Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West Med Block in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation has a 25-year development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration opportunities. In 2006, the Corporation will complete the sale of its interests in certain producing properties located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico for $404 million, before purchase price adjustments. The net book value of these assets held for sale of approximately $70 million has been recorded in other current assets at December 31, 2005. The Corporation estimates that it will record an after-tax gain of $160 million to $180 million in the first quarter on the sale of these assets. 31 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors, must commit to fund the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with FAS No. 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by D&M. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets) and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The 32 Table of Contents amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the timing of future production, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments. In accordance with FAS No. 142, the Corporation’s goodwill is not amortized, but must be tested for impairment annually at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risked present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies. The determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment. Segments: The Corporation has two operating segments, exploration and production and marketing and refining. Management has determined that these are its operating segments because, in accordance with FAS No. 131, these are the segments of the Corporation (i) that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, is the CODM as defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for performing the functions within the Corporation of allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, the Corporation’s operating segments. Hedging: The Corporation may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. Related hedge gains or losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices. Generally, these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) and the changes in fair 33 Table of Contents value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These transactions meet the requirements for hedge accounting, including correlation. The Corporation’s hedges are tested prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to ensure they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using a historical simulation model. The simulation utilizes historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has $1,304 million of deferred hedging losses, after income taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective portion of hedges is included in current earnings. The Corporation’s remaining derivatives, including foreign currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change in fair value is included in income currently. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. New Accounting Standard: In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board reissued Statement No. 123, Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R). This standard requires that compensation expense for all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on fair values. The Corporation adopted FAS 123R as of January 1, 2006. The actual cost of expensing stock options in 2006 and future periods will be based on a number of factors, including the amount of options granted, the terms of such awards and the stock price at the time of grant. The Corporation estimates that the cost of unvested options at December 31, 2005 and the annual grant of employee stock options in February 2006, will increase compensation expense in 2006 by approximately $30 million, before income taxes. Awards of restricted common stock are expensed over the vesting period under existing accounting requirements and will continue to be expensed under FAS 123R. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be captured as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. While overall governance is the responsibility of senior management, the Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. 34 Table of Contents The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years. In 2004, new regulations went into effect that have already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect in 2006. Additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures. Estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading will approximate $75 million, $23 million of which was spent in 2005. The remainder is expected to be spent in 2006. Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be approximately $410 million in total, $160 million of which has already been spent. Capital expenditures for low-sulfur requirements are expected to be $200 million in 2006, with the remainder in 2007. HOVENSA plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 eliminates the Clean Air Act’s mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline. Many states have also enacted bans on the use of MTBE in gasoline, many of which will take effect in 2007-2009. As a result, several companies have announced their intention to cease using MTBE, since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with the Clean Air Act and does not meet the new renewable content requirement. In response to these changes in the gasoline marketplace, the Corporation and HOVENSA will phase out the use of ether based oxygenates in the spring of 2006. The phase out may adversely affect the amount and type of fuels produced at HOVENSA and Port Reading. Both companies are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether unit processing capabilities, which may necessitate additional capital investments. The Corporation and HOVENSA are preparing to meet the renewable content requirement for gasoline and do not anticipate that the impact of this requirement will be significant. As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 77% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls. Settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years. HOVENSA is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the refinery. This project will significantly enhance the refinery’s ability to treat wastewater and better protect the marine environment of St. Croix. The cost to complete the project is approximately $120 million, of which $32 million has already been incurred. The Corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the environmental and social impact of air emissions. On a global scale, climate change is an issue that has prompted much public debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and development. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,” including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this program may be significant, not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the Corporation’s greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation has recently completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement and control of “greenhouse gases.” The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. 35 Table of Contents The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2005, the Corporation’s reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately $77 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was $15 million in 2005, $12 million in 2004 and $12 million in 2003. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for low sulfur projects discussed above, were $3 million in 2005, $1 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value-at-risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The forward purchase and sale of commodities is performed as part of the Corporation’s normal activities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. In some cases, physical purchase and sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in trading results. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date. 36 Table of Contents • Futures: The Corporation uses exchange traded futures contracts on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and are subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. • Energy Commodity Based Securities: Securities where the price is based on the price of an underlying energy commodity. These securities may be issued by a company or government. Value-at-Risk: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the value-at-risk results for trading and non-trading activities. These results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non-trading activities. Trading Non-Trading Activities Activities (Millions of dollars) 2005 At December 31 $ 18 $ 93 Average for the year 11 111 High during the year 18 127 Low during the year 7 93 2004 At December 31 $ 17 $ 108 Average for the year 12 90 High during the year 17 111 Low during the year 7 52 Non-Trading: The Corporation’s non-trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporation’s selling prices. Following is a summary of the Corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at December 31, 2005: Brent Crude Oil Average Thousands of Maturity Selling Price Barrels per Day 2006 $ 28.10 30 2007 25.85 24 2008 25.56 24 2009 25.54 24 2010 25.78 24 2011 26.37 24 2012 26.90 24 37 Table of Contents There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production at year end. As market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages. The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to manage the risk in its marketing activities. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2005 includes after-tax unrealized deferred losses of $1,304 million primarily related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales. The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has $677 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2006 and 2007 ($476 million at December 31, 2004). The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a liability of $31 million at December 31, 2005 (receivable of $49 million at December 31, 2004). The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is estimated to be $64 million at December 31, 2005 ($53 million at December 31, 2004). The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,785 million has a fair value of $4,286 million at December 31, 2005 (debt of $3,835 million at December 31, 2004 had a fair value of $4,327 million). A 15% change in the rate of interest would change the fair value of debt by approximately $250 million at December 31, 2005 and by approximately $260 million at December 31, 2004. Trading: In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market and are reflected in income currently. Total realized losses for the year amounted to $297 million ($79 million of realized gains for 2004). The following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100% of the trading partnership and other trading activities. 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year $ 184 $ 67 Change in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year and still outstanding at the end of year 6 13 Reversal of fair value for contracts closed during the year (23 ) (10 ) Fair value of contracts entered into during the year and still outstanding 942 114 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the year $ 1,109 $ 184 The Corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer By /s/ John B. Hess John B. Hess Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer February 24, 2006 41 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Amerada Hess Corporation We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amerada Hess Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management’s assessment that Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related statements of consolidated income, retained earnings, cash flows, changes in preferred stock, common stock and capital in excess of par value and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated February 24, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on these statements.

4447,HES,HESS CORP,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2006 was $1,916 million compared with $1,242 million in 2005 and $977 million in 2004. Diluted earnings per share were $6.07 in 2006 compared with $3.98 in 2005 and $3.19 in 2004. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,243 million and 1,093 million barrels of oil equivalent. The following table summarizes the components of proved reserves as of December 31: 2006 2005 Crude oil and condensate (millions of barrels) U.S. 138 17 % 124 18 % International 694 83 568 82 Total 832 100 % 692 100 % Natural gas (millions of mcf) U.S. 236 10 % 282 12 % International 2,230 90 2,124 88 Total 2,466 100 % 2,406 100 % E&P net income was $1,763 million in 2006, $1,058 million in 2005 and $762 million in 2004. The improved results were primarily driven by higher average crude oil selling prices during the reporting period and lower hedged crude oil volumes in 2006. See further discussion in Comparison of Results on page 24. Production totaled 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2006, 335,000 boepd in 2005 and 342,000 boepd in 2004. The Corporation estimates that production will be approximately 370,000 boepd to 380,000 boepd in 2007. During 2006, the Corporation commenced production from four new field developments: • The Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) natural gas fields in the United Kingdom came onstream in June 2006 and produced at a combined net rate of approximately 95,000 mcf per day in the second half of the year. • The Okume Complex development (Hess 85%) in Equatorial Guinea commenced production in December. Additional development activities are planned throughout 2007. The Corporation estimates that its net share of 2007 production will average approximately 20,000 boepd. • First production from the Phu Horm onshore gas project (Hess 35%) in Thailand commenced in November. The Corporation estimates that its net share of 2007 production will average approximately 30,000 mcf per day. • Phase 2 production from the ACG fields (Hess 2.7%) in Azerbaijan also commenced during 2006. The Corporation has several additional development projects that will also increase production in the future: • Development of the Shenzi field (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico was sanctioned and first production is anticipated in the second half of 2009. 20 Table of Contents • The Genghis Khan field (Hess 28%) was acquired by the Shenzi partners in February 2007. The field is part of the same geologic structure as the Shenzi development and first production is anticipated in the second half of 2007. • The Ujung Pangkah field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia is scheduled to commence production of natural gas by mid 2007 under an existing gas sales agreement for 440 million mcf (gross) over a 20 year period with an expected plateau rate of 100,000 mcf per day (gross). The Corporation’s plans for Ujung Pangkah in 2007 also include drilling additional development wells and the commencement of a crude oil development project. • Capital investments in the JDA (Hess 50%) will be made during 2007 which will be primarily focused on facilities expansion and development drilling associated with the anticipated commencement of additional contracted gas sales of 400,000 mcf per day (gross) in 2008. It is anticipated that production associated with these additional gas sales will begin ramping up in the fourth quarter of 2007. • Development of the residual oil zone at the Seminole - San Andres Unit (Hess 34.3%) in the Permian Basin is expected to commence in 2007 and production is anticipated to begin in 2009. During 2006, the Corporation’s exploration program had several successes, particularly in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico: • An exploration well on the Corporation’s Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico encountered 475 feet of oil saturated sandstone in Miocene age reservoirs. Drilling of an appraisal sidetrack well on the Pony Prospect was completed in January 2007 which encountered 280 feet of oil saturated sandstone in Miocene age reservoirs after penetrating 60% of its geological objective. Drilling of the sidetrack well was stopped for mechanical reasons after successfully recovering 450 feet of conventional core. The Corporation is currently drilling an appraisal well about 7,400 feet northwest of the discovery well. • On the Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%) in the Mississippi Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a successful appraisal well encountered hydrocarbons approximately 5 miles from the initial discovery well. The operator intends to drill two sidetrack wells in 2007 which will further delineate the field. In addition, during 2006, the Corporation made the following acquisitions and also disposed of several producing properties: • In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners, re-entered its former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions (Hess 8.16%) in Libya. The re-entry terms include a 25-year extension of the concessions and payments by the Corporation to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $359 million. The Corporation’s net share of 2006 production from Libya averaged 23,000 barrels of oil per day. • The Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation has a 25-year development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration opportunities. • During 2006, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and certain U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas producing assets. These asset sales generated total proceeds of $444 million after closing adjustments and an aggregate after-tax gain of $236 million ($369 million before income taxes). Total net production from assets sold was approximately 8,000 boepd at the time of sale. Marketing and Refining The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver consistent financial performance and generate free cash flow. M&R net income was $390 million in 2006, $515 million in 2005 and $451 million in 2004. Total Marketing and Refining earnings decreased in 2006 due to lower margins on refined product sales. Refining 21 Table of Contents operations contributed net income of $236 million in 2006, $346 million in 2005 and $302 million in 2004. Profitability in 2006 was adversely affected by lower refined product margins. Refining facilities at the HOVENSA joint venture and at Port Reading performed reliably in 2006 with the exception of 22 days of unplanned downtime at HOVENSA early in the year. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA totaling $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. In 2006, the Corporation’s Port Reading facility completed its $72 million program for complying with low-sulfur gasoline requirements. Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are estimated to be approximately $420 million, of which $360 million has been incurred through the end of 2006 with the remainder to be spent in 2007. Marketing earnings were $108 million in 2006, $136 million in 2005 and $112 million in 2004. During 2006 and 2005, the Corporation selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring natural gas and electricity customer accounts. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,491 million in 2006 compared with $1,840 million in 2005. At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents totaled $383 million compared with $315 million at December 31, 2005. Total debt was $3,772 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $3,785 million at December 31, 2005. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2006 was 31.7% compared with 37.6% at the end of 2005. The Corporation has debt maturities of $27 million in 2007 and $28 million in 2008. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 908 $ 353 International 2,979 2,031 Total Exploration and Production 3,887 2,384 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 169 106 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 4,056 $ 2,490 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 110 $ 89 International 102 60 $ 212 $ 149 The Corporation anticipates $4.0 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2007, of which $3.9 billion relates to E&P operations. These expenditures include $371 million for the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 22 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,763 $ 1,058 $ 755 Marketing and Refining 390 515 451 Corporate (110 ) (191 ) (85 ) Interest expense (127 ) (140 ) (151 ) Income from continuing operations 1,916 1,242 970 Discontinued operations — — 7 Net income $ 1,916 $ 1,242 $ 977 Income per share from continuing operations — diluted* $ 6.07 $ 3.98 $ 3.17 Net income per share — diluted* $ 6.07 $ 3.98 $ 3.19 * Per share amounts in all periods reflect the impact of a 3-for-1 stock split on May 31, 2006. In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. The following items of income (expense), on an after-tax basis, are included in net income: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Gains from asset sales $ 236 $ 41 $ 54 Income tax adjustments (45 ) 11 19 Accrued office closing costs (18 ) — (9 ) Hurricane related costs — (26 ) — Legal settlement — 11 — Marketing and Refining LIFO inventory liquidation — 32 12 Charge related to customer bankruptcy — (8 ) — Corporate Tax on repatriated earnings — (72 ) — Premiums on bond repurchases — (26 ) — Income tax adjustments — — 13 Insurance accrual — — (13 ) $ 173 $ (37 ) $ 76 The items in the table above are explained, and the pre-tax amounts are shown, on pages 26 through 29. 23 Table of Contents Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s Exploration and Production operations: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues $ 6,524 $ 4,210 $ 3,416 Non-operating income 428 94 90 Total revenues 6,952 4,304 3,506 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,250 1,007 825 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 552 397 287 General, administrative and other expenses 209 140 150 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,159 965 918 Total costs and expenses 3,170 2,509 2,180 Results of operations from continuing operations before income taxes 3,782 1,795 1,326 Provision for income taxes 2,019 737 571 Results from continuing operations 1,763 1,058 755 Discontinued operations — — 7 Results of operations $ 1,763 $ 1,058 $ 762 After considering the Exploration and Production items in the table on page 23, the remaining changes in Exploration and Production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions increased Exploration and Production revenues by approximately $1,900 million in 2006 compared with 2005. In 2005, the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately $870 million compared with 2004. The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Crude oil-per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 60.45 $ 32.64 $ 27.42 Europe 56.19 33.13 26.18 Africa 51.18 32.10 26.35 Asia and other 61.52 54.71 38.36 Worldwide 55.31 33.38 26.70 Crude oil-per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 60.45 $ 51.16 $ 38.56 Europe 58.46 52.22 37.57 Africa 62.80 51.70 37.07 Asia and other 61.52 54.71 38.36 Worldwide 60.41 51.94 37.64 24 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 Natural gas liquids-per barrel United States $ 46.22 $ 38.50 $ 29.50 Europe 47.30 37.13 27.44 Worldwide 46.59 38.08 28.81 Natural gas-per mcf United States $ 6.59 $ 7.93 $ 5.18 Europe 6.20 5.29 3.96 Asia and other 4.05 4.02 3.90 Worldwide 5.50 5.65 4.31 The after-tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by $285 million ($449 million before income taxes) in 2006, $989 million ($1,582 million before income taxes) in 2005 and $583 million ($935 million before income taxes) in 2004. Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 359,000 boepd in 2006, 335,000 boepd in 2005 and 342,000 boepd in 2004. The Corporation anticipates that its 2007 production will average between 370,000 and 380,000 boepd. The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 36 44 44 Europe 109 110 119 Africa 85 67 61 Asia and other 12 7 4 Total 242 228 228 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 10 12 12 Europe 5 4 6 Total 15 16 18 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) United States 110 137 171 Europe 283 274 319 Asia and other 219 133 85 Total 612 544 575 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 359 335 342 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was lower in 2006 due to asset sales and natural decline. Production in Europe was comparable in 2006 and 2005, reflecting increased production from Russia and new production from the Atlantic and Cromarty natural gas fields in the United Kingdom, which offset lower production due to maintenance and natural decline. Increased crude oil production in Africa in 2006 was primarily due to production from Libya. Natural gas production in Asia was higher in 2006 due to increased production from the JDA. 25 Table of Contents Higher sales volumes increased revenue by approximately $400 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue of approximately $80 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $322 million in 2006 and $147 million in 2005 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years, excluding the charges for vacated leased office space and hurricane related costs discussed below. Production expenses increased in 2006 and 2005, principally reflecting higher maintenance expenses, increased costs of services, materials and fuel and higher production taxes resulting from higher oil prices. Production expenses also increased in 2006 due to the re-entry into Libya and continued expansion of operations in Russia and the JDA. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2006, principally reflecting increased production volumes and higher per barrel rates, due to new production from the Atlantic and Cromarty fields and higher asset retirement obligations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2005 versus 2004, principally due to higher per barrel rates. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $10.92 in 2006, $9.07 in 2005 and $7.67 in 2004. Cash operating costs for 2007 are estimated to be in the range of $12.00 to $13.00 per barrel, reflecting industry-wide cost increases and the timing of achieving peak production from new fields. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $8.85 in 2006, $7.88 in 2005 and $7.34 in 2004. Depreciation, depletion and related costs for 2007 are expected to be in the range of $10.00 to $11.00 per barrel. The anticipated increase is due to new fields, including the Okume Complex, which has allocated acquisition cost in its depreciable base. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses were higher in 2006, primarily reflecting higher dry hole costs. Exploration expenses were higher in 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of increased drilling and seismic activity. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for Exploration and Production operations was 53% in 2006, 41% in 2005 and 43% in 2004. After considering the items in the table below, the effective income tax rates were 54% in 2006, 42% in 2005 and 46% in 2004. The increase in the 2006 effective income tax rate was primarily due to taxes on Libyan operations and the increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. During 2006, the Algerian government amended its hydrocarbon tax laws effective August 1, 2006 and the Corporation recorded a net charge of $6 million for the estimated impact of the tax. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2007 is expected to be in the range of 52% to 56%. Other: After-tax foreign currency gains were $10 million ($21 million before income taxes) in 2006, $20 million ($3 million loss before income taxes) in 2005, and $6 million ($29 million before income taxes) in 2004. Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 369 $ 48 $ 55 $ 236 $ 41 $ 54 Income tax adjustments — — — (45 ) 11 19 Accrued office closing costs (30 ) — (15 ) (18 ) — (9 ) Hurricane related costs — (40 ) — — (26 ) — Legal settlement — 19 — — 11 — $ 339 $ 27 $ 40 $ 173 $ 37 $ 64 2006: The gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the United Kingdom. The income tax adjustment represents a one-time adjustment to the Corporation’s deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. 26 Table of Contents 2005: The gains from asset sales represent the disposal of non-producing properties in the United Kingdom and the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased interest in the Pangkah development in Indonesia. The Corporation incurred incremental expenses in 2005, principally repair costs and higher insurance premiums, as a result of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico that are included in production expenses in the income statement. The income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale, which is reflected in non-operating income in the income statement. 2004: The Corporation recognized gains from the sales of an office building in Scotland, a non-producing property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation recorded an after-tax charge for vacated leased office space in the United Kingdom and severance costs, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the income statement. The Corporation’s future Exploration and Production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to $390 million in 2006, $515 million in 2005 and $451 million in 2004. After considering the Marketing and Refining items in the table on page 23, the earnings amounted to $390 million in 2006, $491 million in 2005 and $439 million in 2004 and are discussed in the paragraphs below. The Corporation’s downstream operations include HOVENSA, a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is accounted for using the equity method. Additional Marketing and Refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and other miscellaneous items were $236 million in 2006, $346 million in 2005 and $302 million in 2004. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s net income was $125 million ($203 million before income taxes) in 2006 and $231 million ($376 million before income taxes) in 2005 and $216 million ($244 million before income taxes) in 2004. The lower earnings in 2006 were principally due to lower refined product margins. Refined product margins were higher in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2006 and 2005, the Corporation provided income taxes at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5% on HOVENSA’s income and the interest income on the note receivable from PDVSA. In 2004, income taxes on HOVENSA’s earnings were partially offset by available loss carryforwards. In 2006, the fluid catalytic cracking unit was shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance. During 2005, a crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance. Cash distributions from HOVENSA were $400 million in 2006, $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004. Pre-tax interest on the PDVSA note was $15 million, $20 million and $25 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income is reflected in non-operating income in the income statement. At December 31, 2006, the remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $137 million, which is scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009. Port Reading’s after-tax earnings were $99 million in 2006, $100 million in 2005 and $60 million in 2004. Higher refined product sales volumes were offset by lower margins in 2006 compared with 2005. Refined product margins were higher in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2005, the Port Reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance. 27 Table of Contents The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2006 2005 2004 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 89.7% 92.2% 96.7% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 84.3% 81.9% 92.9% Coker 58 84.3% 92.8% 94.5% Port Reading 65 97.4% 85.3% 83.4% Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $108 million in 2006, $112 million in 2005 and $100 million in 2004, excluding the income from liquidation of LIFO inventories and the charge related to a customer bankruptcy described below. The decrease in 2006 primarily reflects lower margins on refined product sales. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher margins and increased sales volumes compared with 2004. Total refined product sales volumes were 459,000 barrels per day in 2006, 456,000 barrels per day in 2005 and 428,000 barrels per day in 2004. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to income of $46 million in 2006, $33 million in 2005 and $37 million in 2004. Before income taxes, the trading income amounted to $83 million in 2006, $60 million in 2005 and $72 million in 2004 and is included in operating revenues in the income statement. Marketing expenses increased due to higher expenses resulting from an increased number of retail convenience stores, growth in energy marketing operations, and higher utility and compensation related costs. Reported Marketing and Refining earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidation $ — $ 51 $ 20 $ — $ 32 $ 12 Charge related to customer bankruptcy — (13 ) — — (8 ) — $ — $ 38 $ 20 $ — $ 24 $ 12 In 2005 and 2004, Marketing and Refining earnings include income from the liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories. In 2005, earnings include a charge resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the utility industry, which is included in marketing expenses. The Corporation’s future Marketing and Refining earnings may be impacted by volatility in Marketing and Refining margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulatory changes, credit risk and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. 28 Table of Contents Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding the items listed below) $ 156 $ 119 $ 116 Income taxes (benefits) on the above (46 ) (26 ) (31 ) 110 93 85 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax Tax on repatriated earnings — 72 — Premiums on bond repurchases — 26 — Income tax adjustments — — (13 ) Insurance accrual — — 13 Net corporate expenses $ 110 $ 191 $ 85 Excluding the items affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects the expensing of stock options commencing January 1, 2006 and increases in insurance costs. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses in 2007 are estimated to be in the range of $115 to $125 million. In 2005, the American Jobs Creation Act provided for a one-time reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a United States parent. The Corporation repatriated $1.9 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the recognition of an income tax provision of $72 million. The pre-tax amount of bond repurchase premiums in 2005 was $39 million and is reflected in non-operating income in the income statement. The pre-tax amount of the 2004 corporate insurance accrual was $20 million and is reflected in non-operating income. Interest After-tax interest expense was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 301 $ 304 $ 295 Less capitalized interest 100 80 54 Interest expense before income taxes 201 224 241 Less income taxes 74 84 90 After-tax interest expense $ 127 $ 140 $ 151 After-tax interest expense in 2007 is expected to be in the range of $170 to $180 million, principally reflecting an anticipated decrease in capitalized interest due to the achievement of first production from several development projects. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $28,067 million in 2006, an increase of 23% compared with 2005. The increase reflects higher selling prices of crude oil, higher sales volumes and reduced crude oil hedge positions in Exploration and Production activities and higher selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. In 2005, sales and other operating revenues totaled $22,747 million, an increase of 36% compared with 2004. This increase principally reflects higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas in Exploration and Production and higher 29 Table of Contents selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 383 $ 315 Current portion of long-term debt $ 27 $ 26 Total debt $ 3,772 $ 3,785 Stockholders’ equity $ 8,111 $ 6,286 Debt to capitalization ratio* 31.7 % 37.6 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus stockholders’ equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,491 $ 1,840 $ 1,903 Investing activities (3,289 ) (2,255 ) (1,371 ) Financing activities (134 ) (147 ) (173 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 68 $ (562 ) $ 359 Operating Activities: In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $3,491 million, an increase of $1,651 million from 2005, principally reflecting higher earnings, changes in working capital accounts and increased distributions from HOVENSA. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,840 million in 2005 compared with $1,903 million in 2004. The change was due to higher earnings in 2005, offset by a decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally working capital, of $408 million. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $400 million in 2006, $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 590 $ 229 $ 168 Production and development 2,164 1,598 1,204 Acquisitions (including leasehold) 921 408 62 3,675 2,235 1,434 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 169 106 87 Total $ 3,844 $ 2,341 $ 1,521 Capital expenditures in 2006 include payments of $359 million to acquire the Corporation’s former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and $413 million to acquire a 55% working interest in the West Med Block in Egypt. 30 Table of Contents Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 totaled $444 million, including the sale of the Corporation’s interests in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin and onshore U.S. Gulf Coast. Proceeds from asset sales were $74 million and $57 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, principally from the sale of non-producing properties. Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced debt by $13 million in 2006, $50 million in 2005 and $106 million in 2004. The net reductions in debt in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. In 2005, bond repurchases of $600 million were funded by borrowings on the revolving credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States. Dividends paid were $161 million in 2006, $159 million in 2005 and $157 million in 2004. The Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling $40 million, $62 million and $90 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates $4.0 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2007, of which $3.9 billion relates to Exploration and Production operations. The Corporation has maturities of long-term debt of $27 million in 2007 and $28 million in 2008. The Corporation anticipates that it can fund its 2007 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand, cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities. During 2006, the Corporation amended and restated its existing syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility) to increase the credit line to $3.0 billion from $2.5 billion and extend the term to May 2011 from December 2009. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has $2.7 billion available under this facility. The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations, which are sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow up to $800 million, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has $318 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility which was collateralized by approximately $1,100 million of receivables. These receivables are not available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation before repayment of outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed facility. The Corporation has additional unused lines of credit of approximately $370 million, primarily for letters of credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Outstanding letters of credit at December 31, were as follows: 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Lines of Credit Revolving credit facility $ 1 $ 28 Committed short-term letter of credit facilities 1,875 1,675 Uncommitted lines 1,603 982 $ 3,479 $ 2,685 Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $9.7 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2006. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.2 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2006 under the loan agreement covenants. At December 31, 2006, the maximum amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from borrowings under the loan agreement covenants is $3.7 billion. 31 Table of Contents Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. Two credit agencies have assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporation’s debt and one agency has rated it below investment grade. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. In addition, if any one of the three rating agencies were to reduce their rating on the Corporation’s senior unsecured debt, margin requirements with non-trading and trading counterparties at December 31, 2006 would increase by up to approximately $140 million. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period 2008 and 2010 and Total 2007 2009 2011 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long-term debt(a) $ 3,772 $ 27 $ 171 $ 1,340 $ 2,234 Operating leases 2,471 630 567 198 1,076 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 25,800 8,381 8,990 8,429 (b ) Capital expenditures 1,109 809 263 37 — Operating expenses 794 477 187 89 41 Other long-term liabilities 1,316 65 285 220 746 (a) At December 31, 2006, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.0%. (b) The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $4.2 billion annually using year-end 2006 prices. In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year-end market prices. The table also reflects that portion of the Corporation’s planned $4 billion capital investment program for 2007 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2006. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, including asset retirement obligations and pension plan funding requirements. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had a remaining accrual of $49 million for vacated leased office space costs. In 2006, the Corporation recorded an additional $30 million charge for vacated leased office space ($18 million after income taxes) and made payments of $12 million. At December 31, 2005, the accrual was $31 million after reduction for payments of $8 million during 2005. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $140 million as of December 31, 2006. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2006, amounted to $229 million. In addition, the Corporation has 32 Table of Contents agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has $3,427 million of letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 52 Guarantees 301 * $ 353 * Includes $15 million HOVENSA debt and $229 million crude oil purchase guarantees discussed above. The remainder relates to a loan guarantee of $57 million for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $490 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $480 million at December 31, 2005. The Corporation’s December 31, 2006 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 31.7% to 34.4% if these leases were included as debt. See also “Contractual Obligations and Contingencies” above, note 5, “Refining Joint Venture,” and note 16, “Guarantees and Contingencies,” in the notes to the financial statements. Stock Split On May 3, 2006, the Corporation’s shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized common shares from 200 million to 600 million and the board of directors declared a three-for-one stock split. The stock split was completed in the form of a stock dividend that was issued on May 31, 2006 to shareholders of record on May 17, 2006. The common share par value remained at $1.00 per share. All common share and per share amounts in the financial statements and notes and management’s discussion and analysis are on an after-split basis for all periods presented. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities in the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Malaysia, Thailand, Russia, Gabon, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Libya, Egypt and other countries. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency risk. HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a refinery in the United States Virgin Islands. In the past, there have been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations; however, these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial position. The Corporation has a note receivable of $137 million at December 31, 2006 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. All payments are current and the Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance. Subsequent Events In February 2007, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652 and 608 for $371 million. The Genghis Khan development is part of the same geologic structure as the Shenzi development (Hess 28%) and first production from this development is expected in the second half of 2007. 33 Table of Contents Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors, must commit to fund the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 69 Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (FAS No. 69) are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by D&M. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets) and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow 34 Table of Contents estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the timing of future production, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments. In accordance with FAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS No. 142), the Corporation’s goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and Production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the Exploration and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the Exploration and Production segment. Segments: The Corporation has two operating segments, Exploration and Production and Marketing and Refining. Management has determined that these are its operating segments because, in accordance with FAS No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (FAS No. 131), these are the segments of the Corporation (i) that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, is the CODM as defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for performing the functions within the Corporation of allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, the Corporation’s operating segments. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated 35 Table of Contents partnership, trades energy commodities derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under FAS No. 133 are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. Changes in Accounting Policies Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted the provisions of FAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (FAS No. 123R). FAS No. 123R requires that the fair value of all stock-based compensation to employees, including grants of stock options, be expensed over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2005, the Corporation used the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options. Because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the stock on the date of grant, the Corporation did not recognize compensation expense under the intrinsic value method. See note 9, “Share-Based Compensation,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS No. 158). FAS No. 158 requires recognition on the balance sheet of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. As required, the Corporation prospectively adopted the provisions of FAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006. See note 11, “Retirement Plans,” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR-1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities. This FSP eliminates the previously acceptable accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As a result, the Corporation will retrospectively change its method of accounting for 36 Table of Contents refinery turnarounds on January 1, 2007, the effective date of this pronouncement, to recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when such costs are incurred. Under the retrospective method of adoption, the Corporation expects to increase 2006 earnings by approximately $4 million, reduce 2005 earnings by approximately $16 million and increase retained earnings as of January 1, 2005 by approximately $66 million. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also requires additional disclosures related to uncertain income tax positions. As required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The Corporation has not concluded its evaluation of the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS No. 157). FAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which applies broadly to financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements. Additionally, the standard requires increased disclosure of the methods of determining fair value. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its financial statements and, as required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of FAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be captured as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years. In 2004, new regulations went into effect that have already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect in 2006. Additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures. Capital expenditures necessary to comply with low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading were $72 million, of which $23 million was spent in 2005 and the remainder was spent in 2006. Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be approximately $420 million in total, $360 million of which has already been spent and the remainder is expected to be spent in 2007. HOVENSA has and continues to plan to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 eliminated the Clean Air Act’s mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline. Many states have also enacted bans on the use of MTBE in gasoline, many of which will take effect between 2007 and 2009. As a result, several companies have announced their intention to cease using MTBE, since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with the Clean Air Act and does not meet the new renewable content requirement. In response to these changes in the gasoline marketplace, the Corporation and HOVENSA phased out the use of ether based oxygenates during 2006. Both companies are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether unit processing capabilities, which may necessitate additional capital investments. 37 Table of Contents As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 77% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls. Settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years. HOVENSA is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the refinery. This project will significantly enhance the refinery’s ability to treat wastewater and better protect the marine environment of St. Croix. The cost to complete the project is approximately $120 million, of which $55 million has already been incurred. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,” including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this program are significant, not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the Corporation’s greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation has completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement of “greenhouse gases” and is conducting an independently verified audit of its emissions. Once completed, the monitoring protocol will allow for better control of these emissions and assist the Corporation in complying with any future regulatory restrictions. The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2006, the Corporation’s reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately $75 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was $15 million in 2006 and 2005 and $12 million in 2004. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for low sulfur projects discussed above, were $22 million in 2006, $3 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2004. Forward-Looking Information Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward-looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include 38 Table of Contents volumetric, term and value-at-risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The forward purchase and sale of commodities is performed as part of the Corporation’s normal activities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. • Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Value-at-Risk: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the value-at-risk results for trading and non-trading activities. These 39 Table of Contents results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non-trading activities.

Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporation’s selling prices. Following is a summary of the Corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at December 31, 2006: Brent Crude Oil Average Thousands of Maturity Selling Price Barrels per Day 2007 $ 25.85 24 2008 25.56 24 2009 25.54 24 2010 25.78 24 2011 26.37 24 2012 26.90 24 There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production at December 31, 2006. As market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages. The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to manage the risk in its marketing activities. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2006 includes after-tax unrealized deferred losses of $1,338 million primarily related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales. The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had $729 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2007. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a receivable of $51 million at December 31, 2006. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately $80 million at December 31, 2006. The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,772 million has a fair value of $4,105 million at December 31, 2006. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $300 million at December 31, 2006. Trading: In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy 40 Table of Contents commodities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market and are reflected in income currently. Total realized gains for the year amounted to $721 million ($297 million of realized losses for 2005). The following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100% of the trading partnership and other trading activities. 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year $ 1,109 $ 184 Change in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year and still outstanding at the end of year (82 ) 6 Reversal of fair value for contracts closed during the year (547 ) (23 ) Fair value of contracts entered into during the year and still outstanding (115 ) 942 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the year $ 365 $ 1,109 The Corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Hess Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer February 23, 2007 43 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Hess Corporation (formerly, Amerada Hess Corporation) and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management’s assessment that Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated February 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on these statements.

4447,HES,HESS CORP,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2007 was $1,832 million compared with $1,920 million in 2006 and $1,226 million in 2005. Diluted earnings per share were $5.74 in 2007 compared with $6.08 in 2006 and $3.93 in 2005. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 21. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,330 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2007 compared with 1,243 million boe at December 31, 2006 and 1,093 million boe at December 31, 2005. Total proved reserves at year end 2007 increased 87 million boe or 7% from the end of 2006. E&P net income was $1,842 million in 2007, $1,763 million in 2006 and $1,058 million in 2005. The improved results in 2007 as compared to 2006 were primarily driven by higher average crude oil selling prices and increased crude oil and natural gas production. See further discussion in Comparison of Results on page 21. Production averaged 377,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2007 compared with 359,000 boepd in 2006 and 335,000 boepd in 2005. Production in 2007 increased 18,000 boepd or 5% from 2006 reflecting the following developments: • The Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea (Hess 85%), which commenced production in December 2006, exhibited strong reservoir performance and facilities uptime during the year. In January 2008, production reached design capacity of 60,000 boepd, gross (approximately 40,000 boepd, net). • The Ujung Pangkah Field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia commenced natural gas production in April 2007. The Corporation’s net share of production from the field ramped up to an average of 69,000 mcf per day in the fourth quarter of 2007. • The Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) natural gas fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, which came onstream in June 2006, contributed to the Corporation’s year-over-year production growth. Production from the Cromarty Field was shut in during the summer when natural gas prices were seasonally lower and then full production re-commenced in October at higher prices. • The Corporation benefited from a full year of natural gas production from Sinphuhorm (Hess 35%) located onshore Thailand, which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2006, and from production growth in Azerbaijan and Russia. • The Snohvit Field located offshore Norway (Hess 3.26%) commenced natural gas production in September 2007 and the Genghis Khan Field in the Gulf of Mexico (Hess 28%) started crude oil production in October 2007. In 2008, the Corporation expects total worldwide production of approximately 380,000 boepd to 390,000 boepd. During the year, the Corporation progressed development projects that will add to its production in future years: • The expansion of offshore facilities and installation of wellhead platforms was completed in the fourth quarter at Block A-18 of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) (Hess 50%). Full Phase 2 production is expected in the second half of 2008. 18 Table of Contents • The Shenzi development (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico progressed with the installation of tension leg platform tendon piles and hull fabrication. First production is expected to commence in mid-2009. • Development of the residual oil zone at the Seminole-San Andres Unit (Hess 34.3%) in the Permian Basin commenced and is advancing as planned. Production is expected to start up in 2009. • Development of the Ujung Pangkah crude oil project commenced and facilities engineering and construction continue on schedule. Production from this Phase 2 oil project is expected to commence in 2009. • The Jambi Merang natural gas project (Hess 25%) in Indonesia was sanctioned during the year. During 2007, the Corporation’s exploration activities included: • The Corporation gained access to new exploration acreage including two offshore blocks on the Australian Northwest Shelf, licenses WA-390-P (Hess 100%) and nearby WA-404-P (Hess 50%) with total gross acreage of approximately 1.5 million acres. Additionally, more than 125,000 net undeveloped acres were added in the Bakken trend of North Dakota. • On the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a sidetrack from the original discovery well was successfully completed in the first quarter and a second appraisal well is being drilled about 1.5 miles northwest of the original discovery well. • At the Tubular Bells discovery (Hess 20%) on Mississippi Canyon Block 682 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a successful sidetrack well was completed during the first quarter of 2007 and a further appraisal well was spud in October 2007. During 2007, the Corporation completed the following acquisition and divestiture transactions: • In February 2007, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652 and 608, which is part of the same geological structure as the Shenzi development. • In the second quarter, interests in the Scott-Telford fields located offshore United Kingdom were sold for $93 million resulting in an after-tax gain of $15 million ($21 million before income taxes). The Corporation’s share of production from the Scott-Telford fields was approximately 6,500 boepd at the time of sale. Marketing and Refining The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. M&R net income was $300 million in 2007, $394 million in 2006 and $499 million in 2005. Profitability in 2007 and 2006 was adversely affected by lower average margins. Refining operations contributed net income of $193 million in 2007, $240 million in 2006 and $330 million in 2005. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA, a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), totaling $300 million in 2007, $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 454,000 barrels per day in 2007 compared with 448,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 461,000 barrels per day in 2005. In 2007, HOVENSA successfully completed the first turnaround of its delayed coking unit. The Port Reading refinery operated at an average of 61,000 barrels per day in 2007 versus 63,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 55,000 barrels per day in 2005. Marketing earnings were $83 million in 2007, $108 million in 2006 and $136 million in 2005. Total refined product sales volumes averaged 451,000 barrels per day in 2007 compared with 459,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 456,000 barrels per day in 2005. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,507 million in 2007, $3,491 million in 2006 and $1,840 million in 2005, principally reflecting increasing earnings. At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents totaled $607 million compared with $383 million at December 31, 2006. Total debt was 19 Table of Contents $3,980 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $3,772 million at December 31, 2006. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2007 was 28.9% compared with 31.6% at the end of 2006. The Corporation has debt maturities of $62 million in 2008 and $143 million in 2009. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 1,603 $ 908 International 2,183 2,979 Total Exploration and Production 3,786 3,887 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 140 169 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 3,926 $ 4,056 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 192 $ 110 International 156 102 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 348 $ 212 The Corporation anticipates $4.4 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2008, of which $4.3 billion relates to E&P operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,842 $ 1,763 $ 1,058 Marketing and Refining 300 394 499 Corporate (150 ) (110 ) (191 ) Interest expense (160 ) (127 ) (140 ) Net income $ 1,832 $ 1,920 $ 1,226 Net income per share — diluted $ 5.74 $ 6.08 $ 3.93 In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. 20 Table of Contents The following items of income (expense), on an after-tax basis, are included in net income: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Gains from asset sales $ 15 $ 236 $ 41 Asset impairments (56 ) — — Estimated production imbalance settlements (33 ) — — Income tax adjustments — (45 ) 11 Accrued office closing costs — (18 ) — Hurricane related costs — — (26 ) Legal settlement — — 11 Marketing and Refining LIFO inventory liquidations 24 — 32 Charge related to customer bankruptcy — — (8 ) Corporate Estimated MTBE litigation (25 ) — — Tax on repatriated earnings — — (72 ) Premiums on bond repurchases — — (26 ) $ (75 ) $ 173 $ (37 ) The items in the table above are explained, and the pre-tax amounts are shown, on pages 24 through 27.

Selling prices: Higher average selling prices, primarily crude oil, increased Exploration and Production revenues by approximately $740 million in 2007 compared with 2006. In 2006, the increase in average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions increased revenues by approximately $1,900 million compared with 2005. The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Crude oil-per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 69.23 $ 60.45 $ 32.64 Europe 60.99 56.19 33.13 Africa 62.04 51.18 32.10 Asia and other 72.17 61.52 54.71 Worldwide 63.44 55.31 33.38 Crude oil-per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 69.23 $ 60.45 $ 51.16 Europe 60.99 58.46 52.22 Africa 71.71 62.80 51.70 Asia and other 72.17 61.52 54.71 Worldwide 67.79 60.41 51.94 Natural gas liquids-per barrel United States $ 51.89 $ 46.22 $ 38.50 Europe 57.20 47.30 37.13 Worldwide 53.72 46.59 38.08 Natural gas-per mcf United States $ 6.67 $ 6.59 $ 7.93 Europe 6.13 6.20 5.29 Asia and other 4.71 4.05 4.02 Worldwide 5.60 5.50 5.65 The after-tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by $244 million ($399 million before income taxes) in 2007, $285 million ($449 million before income taxes) in 2006 and $989 million ($1,582 million before income taxes) in 2005. Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 377,000 boepd in 2007 compared with 359,000 boepd in 2006 and 335,000 boepd in 2005. The Corporation anticipates that its 2008 production will average between 380,000 and 390,000 boepd. 22 Table of Contents The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 31 36 44 Europe 93 109 110 Africa 115 85 67 Asia and other 21 12 7 Total 260 242 228 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 10 10 12 Europe 5 5 4 Total 15 15 16 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) United States 88 110 137 Europe 259 283 274 Asia and other 266 219 133 Total 613 612 544 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 377 359 335 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). United States: Crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005, principally due to natural decline and asset sales. Europe: Crude oil production in 2007 was lower than in 2006, reflecting natural decline, facilities work on three North Sea fields, and the sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom. These decreases were partially offset by increased production in Russia. Decreased natural gas production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to lower nominations related to the shut-down of a non-operated pipeline in the North Sea and natural decline, partially offset by higher production from the Atlantic and Cromarty natural gas fields in the United Kingdom which commenced in June 2006. Production in Europe was comparable in 2006 and 2005, reflecting increased production from Russia and new production from the Atlantic and Cromarty fields, which offset lower production due to maintenance and natural decline. Africa: Crude oil production increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the start-up of the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea in December 2006. Production in 2006 was higher than 2005 levels, principally due to production from Libya, which the Corporation re-entered in January 2006. Asia and other: Crude oil production increased in 2007 versus 2006, reflecting a combination of an increased entitlement and higher production in Azerbaijan. Higher natural gas production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to new production from the Sinphuhorm onshore gas project in Thailand which commenced in November 2006 and new production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia which commenced in April 2007. These increases were partially offset by the planned shut-down of the JDA to install facilities required for Phase 2 gas sales. Natural gas production was higher in 2006 compared with 2005 due to increased production from the JDA. Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes increased revenue by approximately $240 million in 2007 compared with 2006 and $400 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $409 million in 2007 and $322 million in 2006 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years (excluding the charges for 23 Table of Contents vacated leased office space and hurricane related costs in 2006). The increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to higher production volumes, increased costs of services and materials, higher employee costs and increased production taxes. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.36 in 2007, $10.92 in 2006 and $9.07 in 2005. Cash operating costs in 2008 are estimated to be in the range of $14.00 to $15.00 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding the pre-tax amount of the 2007 asset impairments, depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $232 million and $194 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $10.11 in 2007, $8.85 in 2006 and $7.88 in 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2008 are expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses were lower in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily reflecting lower dry hole costs, partially offset by increased costs related to seismic studies. Exploration expenses were higher in 2006 compared with 2005, principally reflecting higher dry hole costs. Income taxes: The effective income tax rate for Exploration and Production operations was 50% in 2007, 53% in 2006 and 41% in 2005. After considering the items in the table below, the effective income tax rates were 50% in 2007, 54% in 2006 and 42% in 2005. The effective income tax rate increased beginning in 2006 due to the Corporation’s re-entry into Libya and the increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2008 is expected to be in the range of 47% to 51%. Other: The after-tax foreign currency loss was $7 million in 2007, compared with a gain of $10 million in 2006 and $20 million in 2005. Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 21 $ 369 $ 48 $ 15 $ 236 $ 41 Asset impairments (112 ) — — (56 ) — — Estimated production imbalance settlements (64 ) — — (33 ) — — Income tax adjustments — — — — (45 ) 11 Accrued office closing costs — (30 ) — — (18 ) — Hurricane related costs — — (40 ) — — (26 ) Legal settlement — — 19 — — 11 $ (155 ) $ 339 $ 27 $ (74 ) $ 173 $ 37 2007: The gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The pre-tax amount of this charge is reflected in depreciation, depletion and amortization. The estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a reduction of sales and other operating revenues. 2006: The gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the United Kingdom. The related expenses are reflected principally in general and administrative expenses. The income tax adjustment represents a one-time adjustment to the Corporation’s deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. 2005: The gains from asset sales represent the disposal of non-producing properties in the United Kingdom and the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased interest in the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia. The Corporation recorded incremental production expenses in 2005, principally repair costs and higher insurance 24 Table of Contents premiums, as a result of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico. The income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale, which is recorded in other income in the income statement. The Corporation’s future Exploration and Production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to $300 million in 2007, $394 million in 2006 and $499 million in 2005. After considering the Marketing and Refining items in the table on page 21, the earnings amounted to $276 million in 2007, $394 million in 2006 and $475 million in 2005 and are discussed in the paragraphs below. The Corporation’s downstream operations include its 50% interest in HOVENSA, which is accounted for using the equity method. Additional Marketing and Refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous operating activities were $193 million in 2007, $240 million in 2006 and $330 million in 2005. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s net income was $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in 2007, $124 million ($201 million before income taxes) in 2006 and $227 million ($370 million before income taxes) in 2005. The lower earnings in 2007 and 2006 compared to the respective prior years were principally due to lower refining margins. During 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. Certain related processing units were also included in this turnaround. In 2006, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance. During 2005, a crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance. Cash distributions from HOVENSA were $300 million in 2007, $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Pre-tax interest income on the PDVSA note was $9 million, $15 million and $20 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income is reflected in other income in the income statement. At December 31, 2007, the remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $76 million, which is scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009. Port Reading’s after-tax earnings were $75 million in 2007, $104 million in 2006 and $88 million in 2005. Refined product margins were lower in 2007 compared with 2006. Higher refined product sales volumes were offset by lower margins in 2006 compared with 2005. In 2005, the Port Reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2007 2006 2005 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 90.8% 89.7% 92.2% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 87.1% 84.3% 81.9% Coker 58 83.4% 84.3% 92.8% Port Reading 65 93.2% 97.4% 85.3% Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $59 million in 2007, $108 million in 2006 and $112 million in 2005, excluding income from liquidations of LIFO inventories and the charge related to a customer bankruptcy described on page 26. 25 Table of Contents The decreases in 2007 and 2006 primarily reflect lower margins on refined product sales. Total refined product sales volumes were 451,000 barrels per day in 2007, 459,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 456,000 barrels per day in 2005. Total energy marketing natural gas sales volumes, including utility and spot sales, were approximately 1.9 million mcf per day in 2007, 1.8 million mcf per day in 2006 and 1.7 million mcf per day in 2005. In addition, energy marketing sold electricity volumes at the rate of 2,800, 1,400 and 500 megawatts (round the clock) in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to income of $24 million in 2007, $46 million in 2006 and $33 million in 2005. Marketing expenses were comparable in 2007 and 2006, but increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due to higher expenses from an increased number of retail convenience stores, growth in energy marketing operations and increased utility and compensation related costs. Reported Marketing and Refining earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidations $ 38 $ — $ 51 $ 24 $ — $ 32 Charge related to customer bankruptcy — — (13 ) — — (8 ) $ 38 $ — $ 38 $ 24 $ — $ 24 In 2007 and 2005, Marketing and Refining earnings include income from the liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories. In 2005, Marketing and Refining earnings also include a charge resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the utility industry, which is included in marketing expenses. The Corporation’s future Marketing and Refining earnings may be impacted by volatility in margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulatory changes, credit risk and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding the items listed below) $ 187 $ 156 $ 119 Income taxes (benefits) on the above (62 ) (46 ) (26 ) 125 110 93 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax Estimated MTBE litigation 25 — — Tax on repatriated earnings — — 72 Premiums on bond repurchases — — 26 Net corporate expenses $ 150 $ 110 $ 191 Excluding the items affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily reflects higher employee related costs, including stock-based compensation. The increase in corporate expenses in 2006 compared with 2005 principally reflects the expensing of stock options 26 Table of Contents commencing January 1, 2006 and increases in insurance costs. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses in 2008 are estimated to be in the range of $130 to $140 million. In 2007, Corporate expenses include a charge of $25 million ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE litigation. The pre-tax amount of this charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses. In 2005, the American Jobs Creation Act provided for a one-time reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a United States parent. The Corporation repatriated $1.9 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the recognition of an income tax provision of $72 million. The pre-tax amount of bond repurchase premiums in 2005 was $39 million, which was recorded in other income in the income statement. Interest After-tax interest expense was as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 306 $ 301 $ 304 Less capitalized interest 50 100 80 Interest expense before income taxes 256 201 224 Less income taxes 96 74 84 After-tax interest expense $ 160 $ 127 $ 140 The decrease in capitalized interest in 2007 reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007 and the latter portion of 2006. After-tax interest expense in 2008 is expected to be in the range of $165 to $175 million, principally reflecting lower capitalized interest. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $31,647 million in 2007, an increase of 13% compared with 2006. The increase reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of crude oil, higher refined product selling prices and increased sales volumes in electricity. In 2006, sales and other operating revenues totaled $28,067 million, an increase of 23% compared with 2005. The increase reflects higher selling prices of crude oil, higher sales volumes and reduced crude oil hedge positions in Exploration and Production activities and higher selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 607 $ 383 Current portion of long-term debt $ 62 $ 27 Total debt $ 3,980 $ 3,772 Stockholders’ equity $ 9,774 $ 8,147 Debt to capitalization ratio* 28.9 % 31.6 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus stockholders’ equity. 27 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,507 $ 3,491 $ 1,840 Investing activities (3,474 ) (3,289 ) (2,255 ) Financing activities 191 (134 ) (147 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 224 $ 68 $ (562 ) Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was comparable in 2007 and 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $3,491 million in 2006 from $1,840 million in 2005, principally reflecting higher earnings, changes in working capital accounts and increased distributions from HOVENSA. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $300 million in 2007, $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 371 $ 590 $ 229 Production and development 2,605 2,164 1,598 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 462 921 408 3,438 3,675 2,235 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 140 169 106 Total $ 3,578 $ 3,844 $ 2,341 Capital expenditures in 2007 include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $371 million. In 2006, capital expenditures included payments of $359 million to re-enter the Corporation’s former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and $413 million to acquire a 55% working interest in the West Med Block in Egypt. In 2007 the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom. Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 totaled $444 million, including the sale of the Corporation’s interests in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin and onshore U.S. Gulf Coast. Proceeds from asset sales were $74 million in 2005, principally from the sale of non-producing properties. Financing Activities: During 2007, net borrowings were $208 million. The Corporation reduced debt by $13 million in 2006 and $50 million in 2005. In 2005, bond repurchases of $600 million were funded by borrowings on the revolving credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States. Common stock dividends paid were $127 million in 2007. Total common and preferred stock dividends paid were $161 million in 2006 and $159 million in 2005. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling $110 million, $40 million and $62 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates $4.4 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2008, of which $4.3 billion relates to Exploration and Production operations. The Corporation has maturities of long-term debt of $62 million in 2008 and $143 million in 2009. The Corporation anticipates that it can fund its 2008 operations, including capital 28 Table of Contents expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand, projected cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities. The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility), substantially all of which is committed through May 2012. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2007, outstanding borrowings under the facility were $220 million and additional available borrowing capacity under the facility was $2,780 million. The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations, which are sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow up to $800 million, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation had $250 million in outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of $534 million which were collateralized by $1,336 million of Marketing and Refining accounts receivable. These receivables are not available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation before repayment of outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed facility. At December 31, 2007, $600 million of outstanding borrowings under short-term credit facilities are classified as long term based on the Corporation’s available capacity under the committed revolving credit facility. These borrowings consist of the $250 million under the asset-backed credit facility described above, $300 million under a short-term committed facility and $50 million under uncommitted lines at December 31, 2007. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Outstanding letters of credit at December 31, were as follows: 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Revolving credit facility $ — $ 1 Asset-backed credit facility 534 — Committed short-term letter of credit facilities 995 1,875 Uncommitted lines 1,510 1,603 $ 3,039 $ 3,479 A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporation’s debt to equity ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $12.3 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2007. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.6 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2007 under the loan agreement covenants. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on the Corporation’s borrowing arrangements and margin requirements from non-trading and trading counterparties are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period 2009 and 2011 and Total 2008 2010 2012 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long-term debt(a) $ 3,980 $ 62 $ 172 $ 1,543 $ 2,203 Operating leases 3,233 382 849 588 1,414 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 38,548 9,805 14,560 14,058 125 (b) Capital expenditures 1,951 1,118 833 — — Operating expenses 977 537 230 105 105 Other long-term liabilities 1,579 98 481 222 778 (a) At December 31, 2007, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.0%. (b) The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $7.0 billion annually using year-end 2007 prices. In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year-end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including a portion of the Corporation’s planned $4.4 billion capital investment program for 2008, that is contractually committed at December 31, 2007. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2007, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan funding requirements and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. During 2007, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new drillship and related support services for use in its global deepwater exploration and development activities beginning in the middle of 2009. The total payments under this five year contract will approximate $950 million. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $150 million as of December 31, 2007. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2007 amounted to $277 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation has issued $2,978 million of letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the 30 Table of Contents Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 61 Guarantees 292 * $ 353 * Includes $277 million for the HOVENSA crude oil purchases guarantee and the $15 million guarantee on HOVENSA’s debt which are discussed on page 30. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $493 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $490 million at December 31, 2006. The Corporation’s December 31, 2007 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 28.9% to 31.4% if these leases were included as debt. See also “Contractual Obligations and Contingencies” on page 30, Note 4, “Refining Joint Venture,” and Note 15, “Guarantees and Contingencies,” in the notes to the financial statements. Stock Split On May 3, 2006, the Corporation’s shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized common shares from 200 million to 600 million and the board of directors declared a three-for-one stock split. The stock split was completed in the form of a stock dividend that was issued on May 31, 2006. The common share par value remained at $1.00 per share. All common share and per share amounts in the financial statements and notes and management’s discussion and analysis are on an after-split basis for all periods presented. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency risk. HOVENSA owns and operates a refinery in the United States Virgin Islands. In 2002, there was a political disruption in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations; however, this disruption did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial position. The Corporation has a note receivable of $76 million at December 31, 2007 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. All payments are current and the Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration 31 Table of Contents expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 69 Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (FAS No. 69) are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by D&M. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets) and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. 32 Table of Contents The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. In accordance with FAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS No. 142), the Corporation’s goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and Production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the Exploration and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the Exploration and Production segment. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under FAS No. 133 are recognized currently in 33 Table of Contents earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgements include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Changes in Accounting Policies Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR-1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities. This FSP eliminated the previously acceptable accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As a result, the Corporation retrospectively changed its method of accounting to recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when such costs are incurred. The impact of adopting this FSP increased previously reported 2006 earnings by $4 million ($.01 per diluted share). In addition, previously reported 2005 net income decreased by $16 million ($.05 per diluted share) and retained earnings as of January 1, 2005 increased by approximately $48 million. All 2007, 2006 and 2005 financial information reflects this retrospective accounting change. Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also requires additional disclosures related to uncertain income tax positions. See Note 11, “Income Taxes” for further information. Recently Issued Accounting Standard In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS No. 157). FAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosure of a fair value hierarchy, which applies to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements. The standard also requires additional disclosure about the methods of determining fair value. The Corporation as 34 Table of Contents required, will prospectively adopt the provisions of FAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008. The Corporation believes that the impact of adopting FAS No. 157 on net income will not be material. In addition, the Corporation expects to record a reduction in the after-tax charge reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to the crude oil hedging program of approximately $160 million, after income taxes. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years. In 2006, additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect. Additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline. The 2007 Energy Policy Act expanded requirements on the use of renewable content and included several technology forcing provisions. Many states have also enacted or are considering biofuels mandates, which, in combination with national legislation may affect the Registrant’s markets for fuels. As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 80% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls. Settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,” including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this program are significant, not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the Corporation’s greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation has completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement of “greenhouse gases” and has completed an independently verified audit of its emissions. The monitoring protocol in conjunction with the Corporation’s recently formulated Climate Change Network will allow for better control of these emissions and assist the Corporation in developing policies and programs to reduce these emissions and comply with any future regulatory restrictions. The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2007, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately $60 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending 35 Table of Contents was $23 million in 2007 and $15 million in 2006 and 2005. Capital expenditures incurred over several years to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements totaled approximately $400 million at HOVENSA and approximately $70 million at Port Reading. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were $22 million in 2007 and 2006 and $3 million in 2005. Forward-Looking Information Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward-looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value-at-risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. 36 Table of Contents • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. • Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Value-at-Risk: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the value-at-risk results for trading and non-trading activities. These results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non-trading activities. Trading Non-trading Activities Activities (Millions of dollars) 2007 At December 31 $ 10 $ 72 Average 12 63 High 13 72 Low 10 54 2006 At December 31 $ 17 $ 62 Average 20 75 High 22 86 Low 17 62 Non-trading: The Corporation’s non-trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporation’s selling prices. Following is a summary of the Corporation’s outstanding crude oil hedges at December 31, 2007: Brent Crude Oil Average Thousands of Maturity Selling Price Barrels per Day 2008 $ 25.56 24 2009 25.54 24 2010 25.78 24 2011 26.37 24 2012 26.90 24 There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production at December 31, 2007. As market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages. The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures, swaps and options to manage the risk in its marketing activities. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2007 includes after-tax unrealized deferred losses of $1,672 million primarily related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales. The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. 37 Table of Contents The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation had $977 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2008. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a payable of $1 million at December 31, 2007. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately $100 million at December 31, 2007. The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,980 million has a fair value of $4,263 million at December 31, 2007. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $200 million at December 31, 2007. Trading: In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Total realized gains on trading activities for 2007 amounted to $303 million ($721 million in 2006). Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market and unrealized gains or losses are reflected in income currently. The following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100% of the trading partnership and other trading activities. 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year $ 365 $ 1,109 Change in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year and still outstanding at the end of year 193 (82 ) Reversal of fair value for contracts closed during the year (230 ) (547 ) Fair value of contracts entered into during the year and still outstanding (174 ) (115 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the year $ 154 $ 365 The Corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The Corporation’s risk management department regularly compares valuations to independent sources and models.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer By /s/ John B. Hess John B. Hess Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer February 22, 2008 41 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 22, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

4447,HES,HESS CORP,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2008 was $2,360 million compared with $1,832 million in 2007 and $1,920 million in 2006. Diluted earnings per share were $7.24 in 2008 compared with $5.74 in 2007 and $6.08 in 2006. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 21. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,432 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2008 compared with 1,330 million boe at December 31, 2007 and 1,243 million boe at December 31, 2006. Total proved reserves at year end 2008 increased 102 million boe or 8% from the end of 2007. E&P net income was $2,423 million in 2008, $1,842 million in 2007 and $1,763 million in 2006. The improved results in 2008 as compared to 2007 were primarily driven by higher average crude oil selling prices. At December 31, 2008, crude oil selling prices were significantly below the average prices in 2008. Production averaged 381,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2008 compared with 377,000 boepd in 2007 and 359,000 boepd in 2006. Production in 2008 increased 4,000 boepd or 1% from 2007. In 2009, the Corporation currently estimates total worldwide production to be approximately 380,000 boepd to 390,000 boepd. During 2008, the Corporation progressed the following development projects that will add to its production in future years: • In November 2008, upon the commissioning of a third-party gas export pipeline to Thailand, Phase 2 gas sales commenced at Block A-18 of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) (Hess 50%). • In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, development of the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) progressed. Tension leg platform tendons, hull and topsides were installed and flowlines were laid and tested. First production is expected in the second quarter of 2009. • Additional production from a Phase 2 oil project at the Ujung Pangkah Field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia is expected in mid 2009. • Development of a residual oil zone advanced at the Seminole-San Andres Unit (Hess 34%) with the installation of facilities and equipment. During 2008, the Corporation’s exploration activities included: • In the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation successfully completed drilling an appraisal well. The Corporation is evaluating development options for Pony. • At the Corporation’s Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%) located in the Mississippi Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, a third well was successfully drilled during 2008. The operator is evaluating development options for Tubular Bells. • The Corporation completed drilling its initial four exploration wells of a 16 well commitment on the WA-Block-390-P offshore Western Australia (Hess 100%). Three of the four wells discovered natural gas and the Corporation plans to drill five additional exploration wells in 2009. The operator of the WA-Block 404-P (Hess 50%) offshore Western Australia plans to drill three exploration wells in 2009. 19 Table of Contents • The Corporation drilled a successful exploration well in Area 54 offshore Libya (Hess 100%). The Corporation intends to obtain 3D seismic in Area 54 and further drilling is planned. • The Corporation drilled a successful exploration well on the West Med Block (Hess 55%) in Egypt, which encountered natural gas and crude oil. The Corporation is currently conducting engineering studies and further exploratory drilling is planned. • The operator commenced drilling of an exploration well on the BM-S-22 Block (Hess 40%) in the Santos Basin offshore Brazil and filed a Notice of Discovery with the regulators on January 16, 2009. • The Corporation was successful in acquiring new deepwater blocks in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico and the offshore Semai V exploration block in Indonesia. Marketing and Refining The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. M&R net income was $277 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $394 million in 2006. Earnings in 2008 and 2007 reflect lower average margins compared to the prior periods. Refining operations contributed net income of $73 million in 2008, $193 million in 2007 and $240 million in 2006. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA totaling $50 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $400 million in 2006. Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 441,000 barrels per day in 2008 compared with 454,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 448,000 barrels per day in 2006. In 2007, HOVENSA successfully completed the first turnaround of its delayed coker unit. The Port Reading refinery operated at an average of 64,000 barrels per day in 2008 versus 61,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 63,000 barrels per day in 2006. Marketing earnings were $240 million in 2008, $83 million in 2007 and $108 million in 2006. Total refined product sales volumes averaged 472,000 barrels per day in 2008 compared with 451,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 459,000 barrels per day in 2006. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,567 million in 2008, $3,507 million in 2007 and $3,491 million in 2006, principally reflecting increased earnings. At December 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents totaled $908 million compared with $607 million at December 31, 2007. Total debt was $3,955 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $3,980 million at December 31, 2007. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2008 was 24.3% compared with 28.9% at the end of 2007. The Corporation has debt maturities of $143 million in 2009 and $31 million in 2010. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year notes with a coupon of 8.125%. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 2,164 $ 1,603 International 2,477 2,183 Total Exploration and Production 4,641 3,786 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 187 140 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 4,828 $ 3,926 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 211 $ 192 International 179 156 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 390 $ 348 20 Table of Contents The Corporation anticipates $3.2 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2009, of which $3.1 billion relates to E&P operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 2,423 $ 1,842 $ 1,763 Marketing and Refining 277 300 394 Corporate (173 ) (150 ) (110 ) Interest expense (167 ) (160 ) (127 ) Net income $ 2,360 $ 1,832 $ 1,920 Net income per share — diluted $ 7.24 $ 5.74 $ 6.08 In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained, and the pre-tax amounts are shown, on pages 25 through 27. 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ (26 ) $ (74 ) $ 173 Marketing and Refining — 24 — Corporate — (25 ) — $ (26 ) $ (75 ) $ 173 21 Table of Contents Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s Exploration and Production operations: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 9,806 $ 7,498 $ 6,524 Other, net (167 ) 65 428 Total revenues and non operating income 9,639 7,563 6,952 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,872 1,581 1,250 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 725 515 552 General, administrative and other expenses 302 257 209 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,952 1,503 1,159 Total costs and expenses 4,851 3,856 3,170 Results of operations from continuing operations before income taxes 4,788 3,707 3,782 Provision for income taxes 2,365 1,865 2,019 Results of operations $ 2,423 $ 1,842 $ 1,763 * Amounts differ from E&P operating revenues in Note 17 “Segment Information” primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. After considering the Exploration and Production items in the table on page 21, the remaining changes in Exploration and Production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices increased Exploration and Production revenues by approximately $2,100 million in 2008 compared with 2007. At December 31, 2008, the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas had decreased significantly from the average 2008 selling prices indicated below. In 2007, an increase in average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions compared with 2006 increased revenues by approximately $740 million. 22 Table of Contents The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Crude oil-per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 96.82 $ 69.23 $ 60.45 Europe 78.75 60.99 56.19 Africa 78.72 62.04 51.18 Asia and other 97.07 72.17 61.52 Worldwide 82.04 63.44 55.31 Crude oil-per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 96.82 $ 69.23 $ 60.45 Europe 78.75 60.99 58.46 Africa 93.57 71.71 62.80 Asia and other 97.07 72.17 61.52 Worldwide 89.23 67.79 60.41 Natural gas liquids-per barrel United States $ 64.98 $ 51.89 $ 46.22 Europe 74.63 57.20 47.30 Worldwide 67.61 53.72 46.59 Natural gas-per mcf (including hedging) United States $ 8.61 $ 6.67 $ 6.59 Europe 9.44 6.13 6.20 Asia and other 5.24 4.71 4.05 Worldwide 7.17 5.60 5.50 Natural gas-per mcf (excluding hedging) United States $ 8.61 $ 6.67 $ 6.59 Europe 9.79 6.13 6.20 Asia and other 5.24 4.71 4.05 Worldwide 7.30 5.60 5.50 The after-tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in 2008, $244 million ($399 million before income taxes) in 2007 and $285 million ($449 million before income taxes) in 2006. In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedge positions by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 at a per barrel price of $86.95 each year. The deferred after-tax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after-tax loss from the closed positions will be approximately $335 million from 2009 through 2012. The pretax amounts will continue to be recorded as a reduction of revenue and allocated to the selling prices of the Corporation’s African production. Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 381,000 boepd in 2008 compared with 377,000 boepd in 2007 and 359,000 boepd in 2006. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2009 production will average between 380,000 and 390,000 boepd. 23 Table of Contents The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 32 31 36 Europe 83 93 109 Africa 124 115 85 Asia and other 13 21 12 Total 252 260 242 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 10 10 10 Europe 4 5 5 Total 14 15 15 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) United States 78 88 110 Europe 255 259 283 Asia and other 356 266 219 Total 689 613 612 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 381 377 359 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). United States: Crude oil production in the United States was higher in 2008 compared with 2007, principally due to production from new wells in North Dakota and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This increased production was partially offset by the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas production was lower in 2008, primarily reflecting hurricane downtime and natural decline. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd. At December 31, 2008, approximately 15,000 boepd remained shut-in from the hurricanes and this production is expected to be brought back on line by the end of the first quarter of 2009. Crude oil and natural gas production in 2007 decreased compared with 2006 principally due to natural decline and asset sales. Europe: Crude oil production in 2008 was lower than in 2007, due to temporary shut-ins at three North Sea fields, cessation of production at the mature Fife, Fergus, Flora and Angus Fields, and natural decline. These decreases were partially offset by increased production in Russia. Crude oil production in 2007 was lower than in 2006, reflecting natural decline, facilities work on three North Sea fields, and the sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and Telford Fields in the United Kingdom, partially offset by higher Russian production. Natural gas production was comparable in 2008 and 2007, but decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to lower nominations related to the shut-down of a non-operated pipeline and natural decline. The decreases were partially offset by higher natural gas production from the Atlantic and Cromarty Fields in the United Kingdom which commenced in June 2006. Africa: Crude oil production increased in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to higher production at the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea, partially offset by a lower entitlement to Algerian production. Crude oil production increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the start-up of the Okume Complex in December 2006. Asia and other: The change in crude oil production from 2006 through 2008 principally reflects changes to the Corporation’s entitlement to production in Azerbaijan. The increase in 2007 compared with 2006 also reflects increased gross production from the fields in Azerbaijan. Natural gas production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to increased production from Block A-18 in the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) and a full year of production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia. Higher natural gas 24 Table of Contents production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to new production from the Sinphuhorm onshore gas project in Thailand which commenced in November 2006 and production from the Ujung Pangkah Field which commenced in April 2007. These increases were partially offset by the planned shut-down of the JDA to install facilities required for Phase 2 gas sales. Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $200 million in 2008 compared with 2007 and $240 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $321 million in 2008 and $409 million in 2007 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years (excluding the charges for hurricane related costs in 2008 and vacated leased office space in 2006 that are discussed below). The increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to higher production volumes, increased production taxes (due to higher realized selling prices), increased costs of services and materials and higher employee costs. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $15.49 in 2008, $13.36 in 2007 and $10.92 in 2006. Cash operating costs in 2009 are estimated to be in the range of $15.00 to $16.00 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding the pre-tax amount of asset impairments, depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $531 million and $232 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.79 in 2008, $10.11 in 2007 and $8.85 in 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2009 are estimated to be in the range of $13.00 to $14.00 per barrel. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses were higher in 2008 compared with 2007, principally due to higher dry hole costs. Exploration expenses were lower in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily reflecting lower dry hole costs, partially offset by increased seismic studies. Income taxes: After considering the items in the table below, the effective income tax rates for Exploration and Production operations were 49% in 2008, 50% in 2007 and 54% in 2006. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2009 is estimated to be in the range of 57% to 61%. The increase from the 2008 effective rate largely reflects the impact of Libyan taxes in a lower commodity price environment. Foreign Exchange: The after-tax foreign currency loss was $84 million in 2008, compared with a loss of $7 million in 2007 and a gain of $10 million in 2006. The increased foreign currency loss reflects the effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses. Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ — $ 21 $ 369 $ — $ 15 $ 236 Asset impairments (30 ) (112 ) — (17 ) (56 ) — Hurricane related costs (15 ) — — (9 ) — — Estimated production imbalance settlements — (64 ) — — (33 ) — Accrued office closing costs — — (30 ) — — (18 ) Income tax adjustments — — — — — (45 ) $ (45 ) $ (155 ) $ 339 $ (26 ) $ (74 ) $ 173 2008: The charge for asset impairments relates to mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom North Sea. The pre-tax amount of this charge is reflected in depreciation, depletion and amortization. The hurricane costs relate to expenses associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico and are recorded in production expenses. 25 Table of Contents 2007: The gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the United Kingdom North Sea. The estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a reduction of sales and other operating revenues. 2006: The gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the United Kingdom. The related expenses are reflected principally in general and administrative expenses. The income tax adjustment represents a one-time adjustment to the Corporation’s deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. The Corporation’s future Exploration and Production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to $277 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $394 million in 2006. After considering the liquidation of LIFO inventories reflected in the table on page 21 and discussed below, the earnings were $277 million, $276 million and $394 million, respectively. Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous operating activities, were $73 million in 2008, $193 million in 2007, and $240 million in 2006. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s net income was $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008, $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in 2007 and $124 million ($201 million before income taxes) in 2006. The lower earnings in 2008 and 2007, compared with the respective prior years, were principally due to lower refining margins. The 2008 utilization rate for the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA reflects lower utilization due to weak refining margins, planned and unplanned maintenance of certain units, and a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. In 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. Certain related processing units were also included in this turnaround. In 2006, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance. Cash distributions received by the Corporation from HOVENSA were $50 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $400 million in 2006. Pre-tax interest income on the PDVSA note was $4 million, $9 million and $15 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income is reflected in other income in the income statement. At December 31, 2008, the remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $15 million, which was fully repaid in February 2009. Port Reading and other after-tax refining earnings were $43 million in 2008, $79 million in 2007 and $107 million in 2006, also reflecting lower refining margins. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2008 2007 2006 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 88.2% 90.8% 89.7% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 72.7% 87.1% 84.3% Coker 58 92.4% 83.4% 84.3% Port Reading 70 * 90.7% 93.2% 97.4% * Refinery utilization in 2007 and 2006 is based on capacity of 65 thousand barrels per day. 26 Table of Contents Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $240 million in 2008, $59 million in 2007 and $108 million in 2006, excluding income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories in 2007 totaling $38 million before income taxes ($24 million after income taxes). The increase in 2008 primarily reflects higher margins on refined product sales, including sales of retail gasoline operations. Refined product margins were lower in 2007 compared with 2006. Total refined product sales volumes were 472,000 barrels per day in 2008, 451,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 459,000 barrels per day in 2006. Total energy marketing natural gas sales volumes, including utility and spot sales, were approximately 2.0 million mcf per day in 2008, 1.9 million mcf per day in 2007 and 1.8 million mcf per day in 2006. In addition, energy marketing sold electricity volumes at the rate of 3,200, 2,800 and 1,400 megawatts (round the clock) in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $36 million in 2008, compared with earnings of $24 million in 2007 and $46 million in 2006. Marketing expenses increased in 2008, principally reflecting growth in energy marketing activities, higher credit card fees in retail gasoline operations, and increased transportation costs. The Corporation’s future Marketing and Refining earnings may be impacted by external factors, including volatility in margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulations, credit risk, and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding the item described below) $ 260 $ 187 $ 156 Income taxes (benefits) on the above (87 ) (62 ) (46 ) 173 125 110 Item affecting comparability between periods, after tax Estimated MTBE litigation — 25 — Net corporate expenses $ 173 $ 150 $ 110 Excluding the item affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects losses on pension related investments, higher employee costs, and higher professional fees. The increase in net corporate expenses in 2007 compared with 2006 principally reflects higher employee costs, including stock based compensation. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses in 2009 are estimated to be in the range of $165 to $175 million. In 2007, Corporate expenses include a charge of $25 million ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE litigation. The pre-tax amount of this charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses. 27 Table of Contents Interest After-tax interest expense was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 274 $ 306 $ 301 Less capitalized interest 7 50 100 Interest expense before income taxes 267 256 201 Less income taxes 100 96 74 After-tax interest expense $ 167 $ 160 $ 127 The decrease in interest incurred in 2008 principally reflects lower average debt. The decrease in capitalized interest in 2008 reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007 and 2006. Interest expense in each period includes the cost of letters of credit primarily issued to counterparties in hedging and trading activities. After-tax interest expense in 2009 is expected to be in the range of $230 to $240 million. See Future Capital Requirements and Resources for discussion of a $1,250 million note issuance in the first quarter of 2009. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $41,165 million in 2008, an increase of 30% compared with 2007. In 2007, sales and other operating revenues totaled $31,647 million, an increase of 13% compared with 2006. The increase in each year reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of crude oil, higher refined product selling prices and increased sales volumes of electricity. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 908 $ 607 Current portion of long-term debt $ 143 $ 62 Total debt $ 3,955 $ 3,980 Stockholders’ equity $ 12,307 $ 9,774 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.3 % 28.9 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus stockholders’ equity. 28 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,567 $ 3,507 $ 3,491 Investing activities (4,444 ) (3,474 ) (3,289 ) Financing activities 178 191 (134 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 301 $ 224 $ 68 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, increased to $4,567 million in 2008 from $3,507 million in 2007, reflecting increased earnings. Operating cash flow was comparable in 2007 and 2006. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $50 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $400 million in 2006. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 744 $ 371 $ 590 Production and development 2,523 2,605 2,164 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 984 462 921 4,251 3,438 3,675 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 187 140 169 Total $ 4,438 $ 3,578 $ 3,844 Capital expenditures in 2008 include leasehold acquisitions in the United States of $600 million and $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the Corporation’s Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million. In 2007, capital expenditures include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $371 million. In 2006, capital expenditures included payments of $359 million to re-enter the Corporation’s former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and $413 million to acquire a 55% working interest in the West Med Block in Egypt. In 2007, the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom. Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 totaled $444 million, including the sale of the Corporation’s interests in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin and onshore U.S. Gulf Coast. Financing Activities: During 2008, net repayments of debt were $32 million compared with net borrowings of $208 million in 2007. In 2006, the Corporation reduced debt by $13 million. Total common and preferred stock dividends paid were $130 million, $127 million and $161 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits, of $340 million, $110 million and $40 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates $3.2 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2009, of which $3.1 billion relates to Exploration and Production operations. Of the total E&P amount, $1.4 billion is for production and $900 million is for developments, with the remainder for exploration. The anticipated 2009 capital program 29 Table of Contents represents a decrease of approximately $1.6 billion from 2008, primarily as a result of lower crude oil selling prices. The Corporation also has maturities of long-term debt of $143 million in 2009. The Corporation anticipates that it can fund its 2009 operations, including planned capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand, projected cash flow from operations and available credit facilities. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict in the near term as a result of the recent global economic recession. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur. The Corporation will take steps as necessary to protect its financial flexibility, and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt or equity securities, or asset sales. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and remaining availability of the Corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2008 (in millions): Expiration Letters of Remaining Date Capacity Borrowings Credit Issued Total Used Capacity Revolving credit facility May 2012* $ 3,000 $ 350 $ 176 $ 526 $ 2,474 Asset backed credit facility October 2009 500 500 — 500 — Committed lines Various** 1,993 — 1,973 1,973 20 Uncommitted lines Various 1,686 — 1,686 1,686 — Total $ 7,179 $ 850 $ 3,835 $ 4,685 $ 2,494 * $75 million of capacity expires in May 2011. ** Committed lines have expiration dates ranging from 2009 through 2011. The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility), of which $2,925 million is committed through May 2012. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2008, additional available capacity under the facility was $2,474 million. The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit up to $500 million, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2008, outstanding borrowings under this facility were collateralized by $1,249 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary. These receivables are not available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation before repayment of outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed facility. At December 31, 2008, $500 million of outstanding borrowings under the asset-backed credit facility are classified as long-term based on the Corporation’s available capacity under the committed revolving credit facility. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay revolving credit debt and outstanding borrowings on other credit facilities. The remainder of the proceeds is available for working capital and other corporate purposes. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporation’s debt to equity ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $16.6 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2008. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.8 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2008 under the loan agreement covenants. In order to reduce credit risk, the Corporation has agreements with counterparties to exchange collateral which is determined based on the fair values of positions held under these agreements. The Corporation’s $3.8 billion of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2008 were primarily issued to satisfy collateral requirements. Additionally, the Corporation has posted cash collateral of approximately $394 million and has received cash 30 Table of Contents collateral of approximately $705 million from its hedging and trading counterparties. Changes in commodity prices can have a material impact on collateral requirements under these agreements. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on the Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from non-trading and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period 2010 and 2012 and Total 2009 2011 2013 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long-term debt* $ 3,955 $ 143 $ 733 $ 907 $ 2,172 Operating leases 3,561 551 725 638 1,647 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 24,252 8,602 8,204 7,344 102 ** Capital expenditures 1,356 929 427 — — Operating expenses 1,011 486 321 77 127 Other long-term liabilities 2,011 134 474 93 1,310 * At December 31, 2008, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.7%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $4.0 billion annually using year-end 2008 prices. In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year-end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including a portion of the Corporation’s planned $3.2 billion capital investment program for 2009 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2008. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2008, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. During 2007, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new drillship and related support services for use in its global deepwater exploration and development activities beginning in the middle of 2009. The total payments under this five year contract are expected to be approximately $950 million. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $175 million as of December 31, 2008. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil 31 Table of Contents purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2008 amounted to $78 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 126 Guarantees 93 $ 219 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $491 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $493 million at December 31, 2007. The Corporation’s December 31, 2008 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 24.3% to 26.5% if these leases were included as debt. See also Note 4, “Refining Joint Venture,” and Note 16, “Guarantees and Contingencies,” in the notes to the financial statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk. HOVENSA owns and operates a refinery in the United States Virgin Islands. In 2002, there was a political disruption in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations; however, this disruption did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s financial position. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders’ equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the 32 Table of Contents capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 69 Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (FAS 69) are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by D&M. On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission published a final rule which revises its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements. The revisions are effective for filings on Form 10-K for fiscal years ending December 31, 2009. The Corporation is evaluating the impact of these requirements on its oil and gas reserve estimates and disclosures. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate, The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The 33 Table of Contents Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. In accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Corporation’s goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and Production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the Exploration and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the Exploration and Production segment. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both non-trading and trading activities. In non-trading activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair 34 Table of Contents value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. In determining fair value, the Corporation uses various valuation approaches, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation adopted the provisions of FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), effective January 1, 2008. FAS 157 establishes a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value for each financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. In addition, fair values for the majority of the Corporation’s supplemental pension plan investments are considered Level 1, since they are determined using quotations from national securities exchanges. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve, but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgements include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. 35 Table of Contents The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. In accordance with FAS 158, Employer’s Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158), the Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporation’s financial statements. Changes in Accounting Policies As discussed on page 35, the Corporation adopted FAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. The impact of adopting FAS 157 was not material to the Corporation’s results of operations. Upon adoption, the Corporation recorded a reduction in the net deferred hedge losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, which increased stockholders’ equity by $193 million, after income taxes. Effective December 31, 2008, the Corporation applied the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force 08-5, Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement (EITF 08-5). Upon adoption, the Corporation revalued certain derivative liabilities collateralized by letters of credit to reflect the Corporation’s credit rating rather than the credit rating of the issuing bank. The adoption resulted in an increase in sales and other operating revenues of approximately $13 million and an increase in other comprehensive income of approximately $78 million, with a corresponding decrease in derivative liabilities recorded within accounts payable. Recently Issued Accounting Standard In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. The Corporation will adopt the provisions of FAS 160 effective January 1, 2009 and estimates that adoption will result in a decrease in other long term liabilities and an increase in stockholders’ equity of approximately $85 million. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by 36 Table of Contents environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation distributes fuel oils in the United States. Proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils. If adopted, these proposals could require capital expenditures by the Registrant and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards. As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control nearly 90% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA. While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court, additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred over a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not expected to be material to the Corporation. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,” including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern with potentially significant consequences for society and the energy industry. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is developing and implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2008, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately $61 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was $23 million in 2008, $23 million in 2007 and $15 million in 2006. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were $15 million in 2008 and $22 million in 2007 and 2006. Forward-Looking Information Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward-looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value-at-risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British pound, the Norwegian krone, and the Danish krone, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. • Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. 38 Table of Contents Value-at-Risk: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the value-at-risk results for trading and non-trading activities. These results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non-trading activities. Trading Non-trading Activities Activities (Millions of dollars) 2008 At December 31 $ 17 $ 13 Average 13 90 High 17 140 Low 11 13 2007 At December 31 $ 10 $ 72 Average 12 63 High 13 72 Low 10 54 Non-trading: The Corporation’s non-trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporation’s selling prices. In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedge positions by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 at a per barrel price of $86.95 each year. The after-tax deferred losses related to closed crude oil contracts will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production at December 31, 2008. The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures, swaps and options to manage the risk in its marketing activities. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2008 includes after-tax deferred losses of $1,478 million primarily related to closed crude oil contracts that were used as hedges of exploration and production sales. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward contracts for various currencies including the British pound, the Norwegian krone and the Danish krone. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had $896 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2009. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a payable of $75 million at December 31, 2008. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20% change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately $165 million at December 31, 2008. The Corporation’s outstanding debt of $3,955 million has a fair value of $3,883 million at December 31, 2008. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $85 million at December 31, 2008. Trading: In trading activities, the Corporation is primarily exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer By /s/ John B. Hess John B. Hess Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer February 20, 2009 42 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 20, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

4447,HES,HESS CORP,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades, refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2009 was $740 million compared with $2,360 million in 2008 and $1,832 million in 2007. Diluted earnings per share were $2.27 in 2009 compared with $7.24 in 2008 and $5.74 in 2007. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 20. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,437 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2009 compared with 1,432 million boe at December 31, 2008 and 1,330 million boe at December 31, 2007. Total proved reserves additions for 2009 were 157 million boe. These additions replaced approximately 103% of the Corporation’s 2009 production. E&P net income was $1,042 million in 2009, $2,423 million in 2008 and $1,842 million in 2007. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $51.62 per barrel in 2009, $82.04 in 2008, and $63.44 in 2007, including the impact of hedging. The variance in E&P earnings between years was primarily driven by the fluctuations in average realized crude oil selling prices. Production averaged 408,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2009 compared with 381,000 boepd in 2008 and 377,000 boepd in 2007. Production in 2009 increased 27,000 boepd or 7% from 2008. In 2010, the Corporation currently estimates total worldwide production will average between 400,000 and 410,000 boepd. The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2009: • In March, production commenced at the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production from Shenzi averaged approximately 25,000 boepd for 2009. • The Corporation sanctioned the Bakken shale play development in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. The Corporation plans to expand production facilities and increase the rig count to 10 from 3 over the next 18 months, and invest about $1 billion per year over the next five years. As a result, the Corporation projects an increase in net production from approximately 10,000 boepd in 2009 to approximately 80,000 boepd in 2015. • In December 2009, the Corporation agreed to a strategic exchange of all of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field (Hess 9%) in the United Kingdom for an additional 28% interest in the Valhall Field (currently Hess 28%) and an additional 25% interest in the Hod Field (currently Hess 25%), which are both offshore Norway. The transaction which has an effective date of January 1, 2010, is subject to various regulatory and other approvals. In addition, the partners are in discussions regarding the applicability of pre-emption to this transaction. • In the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia, the Corporation drilled seven exploration wells in 2009 on WA-390-P Block (Hess 100%), six of which were natural gas discoveries. Through December 31, 2009, the Corporation has drilled 11 of the 16 commitment wells on the block, nine of which were natural gas discoveries. The Corporation plans to drill the remaining five commitment wells on the block in 2010. On WA-404-P Block (Hess 50%), the operator completed a successful exploration well in 2009 and plans to drill the remaining eight commitment wells in 2010. In January 2010, the operator announced that the first well of the 2010 program discovered natural gas. • At the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, engineering and design work for field development progressed during 2009. The Corporation plans to drill an appraisal well on Green Canyon Block 469 in 2010. • Two exploration wells were completed on Block BM-S-22 (Hess 40%) offshore Brazil. A notice of discovery was filed for the first well and the second well was expensed. In 2010, the operator of BM-S-22 18 Table of Contents plans to commence drilling of a third exploration well in the second half of the year. In 2009, the Corporation also drilled an exploration well on BM-ES-30, which was expensed. • The Corporation successfully flow tested the discovery well in exploration Area 54 (Hess 100%) offshore Libya and subsequently drilled and successfully flow tested a down-dip appraisal well on the block. In 2010, the Corporation plans to reprocess 3D seismic, integrating acquired well information and will continue technical and commercial evaluation of the block. • The Corporation acquired rights to explore a total of more than 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus gas shale formation in Pennsylvania. The Corporation is operator and holds a 100% interest on approximately 50,000 acres and holds a 50% non-operated interest in the remaining acreage. Exploration drilling activity is expected to commence in 2010. Marketing and Refining The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. M&R net income was $127 million in 2009, $277 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. The declining earnings were due to lower average margins, which include the effect of the global economic downturn that began in 2008 and continued into 2009. Refining operations contributed net income (loss) of $(87) million in 2009, $73 million in 2008 and $193 million in 2007. Marketing earnings were $168 million in 2009, $240 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,046 million in 2009, $4,688 million in 2008 and $3,627 million in 2007, principally reflecting fluctuations in earnings. At December 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,362 million compared with $908 million at December 31, 2008. Total debt was $4,467 million at December 31, 2009 compared with $3,955 million at December 31, 2008. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt under the revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings on other credit facilities. In December 2009, the Corporation issued $750 million of 30 year bonds at a coupon of 6% and tendered for $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The Corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds in December 2009 and repurchased the remaining $116 million of these bonds in January 2010. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2009 was 24.8% compared with 24.2% at the end of 2008. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 1,200 $ 2,164 International 1,927 2,477 Total Exploration and Production 3,127 4,641 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 187 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 3,245 $ 4,828 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 144 $ 211 International 183 179 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 327 $ 390 The Corporation anticipates investing $4.1 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2010, substantially all of which relates to E&P operations. 19 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,042 $ 2,423 $ 1,842 Marketing and Refining 127 277 300 Corporate (205 ) (173 ) (150 ) Interest expense (224 ) (167 ) (160 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 740 $ 2,360 $ 1,832 Net income per share — diluted $ 2.27 $ 7.24 $ 5.74 The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 23 through 25. 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ 45 $ (26 ) $ (74 ) Marketing and Refining 12 — 24 Corporate (60 ) — (25 ) $ (3 ) $ (26 ) $ (75 ) In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s E&P operations: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 6,835 $ 9,806 $ 7,498 Other, net 207 (167 ) 65 Total revenues and non operating income 7,042 9,639 7,563 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,805 1,872 1,581 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 829 725 515 General, administrative and other expenses 255 302 257 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,167 1,952 1,503 Total costs and expenses 5,056 4,851 3,856 Results of operations before income taxes 1,986 4,788 3,707 Provision for income taxes 944 2,365 1,865 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 1,042 $ 2,423 $ 1,842 * Amounts differ from E&P operating revenues in Note 16, Segment Information, primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. 20 Table of Contents After considering the E&P items in the table on page 23, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Lower average selling prices reduced E&P revenues by approximately $4,000 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $2,100 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Crude oil-per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 60.67 $ 96.82 $ 69.23 Europe 47.02 78.75 60.99 Africa 48.91 78.72 62.04 Asia and other 63.01 97.07 72.17 Worldwide 51.62 82.04 63.44 Crude oil-per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 60.67 $ 96.82 $ 69.23 Europe 47.02 78.75 60.99 Africa 60.79 93.57 71.71 Asia and other 63.01 97.07 72.17 Worldwide 56.74 89.23 67.79 Natural gas liquids-per barrel United States $ 36.57 $ 64.98 $ 51.89 Europe 43.23 74.63 57.20 Worldwide 38.47 67.61 53.72 Natural gas-per mcf (including hedging) United States $ 3.36 $ 8.61 $ 6.67 Europe 5.15 9.44 6.13 Asia and other 5.06 5.24 4.71 Worldwide 4.85 7.17 5.60 Natural gas-per mcf (excluding hedging) United States $ 3.36 $ 8.61 $ 6.67 Europe 5.15 9.79 6.13 Asia and other 5.06 5.24 4.71 Worldwide 4.85 7.30 5.60 In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedges, covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 though 2012, by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after-tax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after-tax loss from the closed positions will be approximately $335 million from 2010 through 2012. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. Crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced E&P earnings by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in 2008 and $244 million ($399 million before income taxes) in 2007. Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 408,000 boepd in 2009 compared with 381,000 boepd in 2008 and 377,000 boepd in 2007. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2010 production will average between 400,000 and 410,000 boepd. 21 Table of Contents The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Crude oil (barrels per day) United States 60 32 31 Europe 83 83 93 Africa 120 124 115 Asia and other 16 13 21 Total 279 252 260 Natural gas liquids (barrels per day) United States 11 10 10 Europe 3 4 5 Total 14 14 15 Natural gas (mcf per day) United States 93 78 88 Europe 151 255 259 Asia and other 446 356 266 Total 690 689 613 Barrels of oil equivalent* (barrels per day) 408 381 377 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). United States: Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi Field and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes. Crude oil production was slightly higher in 2008 compared with 2007, principally due to production from new wells in North Dakota and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, largely offset by the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas production was lower in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily reflecting hurricane downtime and natural decline. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd. Europe: Crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008, as higher production in Russia offset lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea. Crude oil production in 2008 was lower than in 2007, due to temporary shut-ins at three North Sea fields, the cessation of production at the Fife, Fergus, Flora and Angus fields, and natural decline. These decreases were partially offset by increased production in Russia. Natural gas production was lower in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decline at the Atlantic and Cromarty fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower production from the Ceiba Field. Crude oil production increased in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to higher production at the Okume Complex, partially offset by a lower entitlement to Algerian production. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2009 was higher than in 2008, primarily due to a full year of Phase 2 gas sales from the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA). Natural gas production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to increased production from Block A-18 in the JDA and a full year of production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia. The decrease in crude oil production in 2008 from 2007 principally reflects changes to the Corporation’s entitlement to production in Azerbaijan. Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $1,030 million in 2009 compared with 2008 and $200 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability explained on page 23, cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, decreased by $119 million in 2009 and increased by $321 million in 2008 compared with the corresponding amounts in the prior years. The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower 22 Table of Contents production taxes (due to lower realized selling prices), the cessation of production at several North Sea fields, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the impact of higher production volumes. The increase in costs in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased production taxes (due to higher realized selling prices), increased cost of services and materials and higher employee costs. Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $192 million in 2009 and $531 million in 2008, compared with the corresponding amounts in the prior years. The increases in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, unit costs were as follows. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.70 in 2009, $15.49 in 2008 and $13.36 in 2007. Cash operating costs in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.19 in 2009, $13.79 in 2008 and $10.11 in 2007. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to higher dry hole costs and lease amortization, partially offset by lower geological and seismic expense. Exploration expenses increased in 2008 compared to 2007, mainly due to higher dry hole costs. Income taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 48% in 2009, 49% in 2008 and 50% in 2007. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2010 is estimated to be in the range of 47% to 51%. Foreign Exchange: The after-tax foreign currency losses were $10 million in 2009, $80 million in 2008 and $7 million in 2007. The foreign currency loss in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses. Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Royalty dispute resolution $ 143 $ — $ — $ 89 $ — $ — Gains from asset sales — — 21 — — 15 Reductions in carrying values of assets (77 ) (30 ) (112 ) (44 ) (17 ) (56 ) Hurricane related costs — (15 ) — — (9 ) — Estimated production imbalance settlements — — (64 ) — — (33 ) $ 66 $ (45 ) $ (155 ) $ 45 $ (26 ) $ (74 ) 2009: In October 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized an after-tax gain of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre-tax gain of $143 million is reported in Other, net within the Statement of Consolidated Income. After-tax charges of $44 million ($77 million before income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and two short-lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre-tax amount of the impairment charges totaling $52 million were reported in Depreciation, depletion and amortization and the majority of the $25 million in inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 23 Table of Contents 2008: The charge for asset impairments relates to mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom North Sea. The hurricane costs relate to expenses associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico and are recorded in Production expenses. 2007: The gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the Corporation’s interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the United Kingdom North Sea. The estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a reduction of Sales and other operating revenues. The Corporation’s future E&P earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, political risk, industry costs, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from M&R activities amounted to $127 million in 2009, $277 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 20 and discussed below, the earnings were $115 million, $277 million and $276 million, respectively. Refining: Refining earnings (losses), which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous operating activities, were $(87) million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment), $73 million in 2008, and $193 million in 2007. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results was a loss of $141 million ($229 million before income taxes) in 2009, and income of $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008 and $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in 2007. The declining earnings were principally due to lower refining margins. The 2009 and 2008 utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins and planned and unplanned maintenance. The 2008 utilization rates also reflect a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. In 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. Certain related processing units were also included in this turnaround. In January 2010, HOVENSA commenced a turnaround of its FCC unit which is expected to take approximately 40 days. The Corporation’s estimated share of HOVENSA’s turnaround expenses after income taxes is expected to be approximately $20 million. Cash distributions received by the Corporation from HOVENSA were $50 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. In 2009, the remaining balance on the note issued by PDVSA at inception of the joint venture was fully repaid. Other after-tax refining earnings, principally from Port Reading operations, were $43 million in both 2009 and 2008 and $79 million in 2007, reflecting lower margins. The Corporation is planning a turnaround for the Port Reading refining facility in the second quarter of 2010, which is expected to take approximately 35 days. The estimated after-tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround are approximately $25 million. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2009 2008 2007 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 80.3% 88.2% 90.8% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 70.2% 72.7% 87.1% Coker 58 81.6% 92.4% 83.4% Port Reading 70 90.2% 90.7% 93.2% Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $168 million in 2009, $240 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007, including income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories in 2007 totaling $24 million ($38 million before income taxes). 24 Table of Contents The decrease in earnings in 2009 compared with 2008 reflects lower margins in a weak economic environment. The increase in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects higher margins on refined product sales, including sales of retail gasoline operations. The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes: 2009 2008 2007 Refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 473 472 451 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,010 1,955 1,890 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,306 3,152 2,821 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to earnings of $46 million in 2009, a loss of $36 million in 2008 and earnings of $24 million in 2007. Marketing expenses decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008, principally reflecting lower retail credit card fees. Marketing expenses increased in 2008 compared with 2007, due to growth in energy marketing activities, higher retail credit card fees, and increased transportation costs. The Corporation’s future M&R earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulations, credit risk, and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses $ 227 $ 260 $ 187 Income taxes (benefits) (82 ) (87 ) (62 ) After-tax corporate expenses 145 173 125 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax 60 — 25 Net corporate expenses $ 205 $ 173 $ 150 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the decrease in corporate expenses in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflects gains on supplemental pension related investments, together with lower employee and professional costs, partly offset by higher bank facility fees. The increase in corporate expenses in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects losses on supplemental pension related investments and higher employee and professional costs. After-tax corporate expenses in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $160 to $170 million. In 2009, the Corporation recorded after-tax charges of $34 million ($54 million before income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $26 million ($42 million before income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. The pre-tax charge in connection with the debt repurchase was recorded in Other, net, and the pre-tax amount of the retirement benefits and severance costs was recorded in General and administrative expenses within the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2007, Corporate expenses included a charge of $25 million ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE litigation. The pre-tax amount of this charge was recorded in General and administrative expenses. 25 Table of Contents Interest Interest expense was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 366 $ 274 $ 306 Less capitalized interest 6 7 50 Interest expense before income taxes 360 267 256 Less income taxes 136 100 96 After-tax interest expense $ 224 $ 167 $ 160 The increase in interest expense primarily reflects higher debt and fees for letters of credit. The decrease in capitalized interest in 2009 and 2008 compared to 2007 reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007. After-tax interest expense in 2010 is expected to be in the range of $220 to $230 million. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $29,614 million in 2009, a decrease of 28% compared with 2008. In 2008, sales and other operating revenues totaled $41,134 million, an increase of 30% compared with 2007. The fluctuations in each year primarily reflect changes in crude oil and refined product selling prices. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,362 $ 908 Current portion of long-term debt $ 148 $ 143 Total debt $ 4,467 $ 3,955 Total equity $ 13,528 $ 12,391 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.8 % 24.2 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,046 $ 4,688 $ 3,627 Investing activities (2,924 ) (4,444 ) (3,474 ) Financing activities 332 57 71 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 454 $ 301 $ 224 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $3,046 million in 2009 compared with $4,688 million in 2008, reflecting lower earnings. Operating 26 Table of Contents cash flow increased to $4,688 million in 2008 from $3,627 million in 2007, primarily reflecting increased earnings. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $50 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 611 $ 744 $ 371 Production and development 1,927 2,523 2,605 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 262 984 462 2,800 4,251 3,438 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 187 140 Total $ 2,918 $ 4,438 $ 3,578 Capital expenditures in 2009 include acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A-18 of the JDA. Capital expenditures in 2008 include $600 million for leasehold acquisitions in the United States and $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the Corporation’s Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million. In 2007, capital expenditures include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $371 million. In 2007, the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom. Financing Activities: During 2009, net proceeds from borrowings were $447 million. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt under the revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings on other credit facilities. In December 2009, the Corporation issued $750 million of 30 year bonds with a coupon of 6% and tendered for the $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The Corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds in December 2009. The remaining $116 million of 2011 bonds, classified as Current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2009, was redeemed in January 2010, resulting in a charge of approximately $11 million ($7 million after income taxes). During 2008, net repayments of debt were $32 million, compared with net borrowings of $208 million in 2007. Total common stock dividends paid were $131 million, $130 million and $127 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits, of $18 million, $340 million and $111 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $4.1 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2010, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. In the Corporation’s M&R operations, refining margins are currently weak, which have adversely affected HOVENSA’s liquidity position. The Corporation intends to provide its share of any necessary financial support for HOVENSA. The Corporation expects to fund its 2010 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments and any necessary financial support for HOVENSA, with existing cash on-hand, cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities. Crude oil prices, natural gas prices and refining margins are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and/or asset sales. 27 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2009 (in millions): Expiration Letters of Available Date Capacity Borrowings Credit Issued Total Used Capacity Revolving credit facility May 2012(a) $ 3,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,000 Asset backed credit facility July 2010(b) 741 — 500 500 241 Committed lines Various(c) 2,115 — 1,155 1,155 960 Uncommitted lines Various(c) 1,192 — 1,192 1,192 — Total $ 7,048 $ — $ 2,847 $ 2,847 $ 4,201 (a) $75 million expires in May 2011. (b) Total capacity of $1.0 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (c) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates primarily through 2010. The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility), of which $2,925 million is committed through May 2012. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, available capacity under the facility was $3.0 billion. The Corporation has a 364 day asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its M&R operations. At December 31, 2009, under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1.0 billion, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2009, outstanding letters of credit under this facility were collateralized by a total of $1,326 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $18.1 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2009. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $3.7 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2009 under the loan agreement covenants. The Corporation’s $2,847 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2009 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 14, Risk Management and Trading Activities. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. 28 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period 2011 and 2013 and Total 2010 2012 2014 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long-term debt* $ 4,467 $ 148 $ 66 $ 370 $ 3,883 Operating leases 3,282 482 695 677 1,428 Purchase obligations Supply commitments** 37,870 13,158 12,546 12,118 48 Capital expenditures 939 745 191 2 1 Operating expenses 937 457 276 70 134 Other long-term liabilities 2,095 145 366 199 1,385 * At December 31, 2009, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.3%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $6.0 billion annually using year-end 2009 prices, which have been included in the table through 2014. In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year-end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporation’s planned $4.1 billion capital investment program for 2010 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2009. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2009, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new drillship and related support services for use in its global deepwater exploration and development activities. The total payments under this five year contract are expected to be approximately $950 million. The Corporation took delivery of the drillship in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2012, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $184 million as of December 31, 2009. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2009 it amounted to $121 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. 29 Table of Contents The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2009 as shown below: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 100 Guarantees 136 $ 236 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $412 million at December 31, 2009 compared with $491 million at December 31, 2008. The Corporation’s December 31, 2009 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 24.8% to 26.5% if these leases were included as debt. See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 15, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year-end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated 30 Table of Contents proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engaged an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the E&P operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the E&P segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. 31 Table of Contents The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the E&P segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the E&P segment. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Inputs include discounted cash flow calculations and other unobservable data. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value. These fair value measurements include assets and liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and long-lived assets and goodwill measured at fair value in an impairment assessment. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. 32 Table of Contents Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporation’s financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with 33 Table of Contents generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Changes in Accounting Policies The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) became effective on July 1, 2009. The ASC combined multiple sources of authoritative accounting literature into a single source of authoritative GAAP organized by accounting topic. Since the ASC was not intended to change existing GAAP, the only impact on the Corporation’s financial statements was that specific references to accounting principles have been changed to refer to the ASC. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard for the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary (ASC 810 — Consolidation, originally issued as FAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51). As required, the Corporation retrospectively applied the presentation and disclosure requirements of this standard. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 noncontrolling interests of $144 million and $84 million, respectively, have been classified as a component of equity. Prior to adoption, noncontrolling interests were classified in Other liabilities. Net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests must also be separately reported in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Certain other amounts in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform with the presentation requirements of this standard. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard that expanded the qualitative, quantitative and credit risk disclosure requirements related to an entity’s use of derivative instruments (ASC 815 — Derivatives and Hedging, originally issued as FAS 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). See Note 14, Risk Management and Trading Activities, for these disclosures. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation also adopted the FASB staff position that requires the application of the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (ASC 820 — Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, originally issued as FASB Staff Position No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157). Such fair value measurements are determined based on the same fair value hierarchy of inputs required to measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. The impact of this accounting standard was not material to the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements. Effective June 30, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard which provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued (ASC 855 — Subsequent Events, originally issued as FAS 165, Subsequent Events). The adoption of this standard did not impact the Corporation’s existing practice of evaluating subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued. In January 2010, the FASB adopted an accounting standards update (ASU) Extractive Activities — Oil and Gas (ASC 932 — Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures) which is effective for financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 and amends the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The objective of the ASU was to align accounting standards with the previously issued SEC requirements on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure. The main provisions of the ASU are to expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the year-end 34 Table of Contents price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these disclosures. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB amended existing accounting standards to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (ASC 860 — Transfers and Servicing, originally issued as FAS 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140), which did not require consolidation under existing GAAP. The FASB also amended existing accounting standards to limit the circumstances in which transferred financial assets should be derecognized (ASC 810 — Consolidation, originally issued as FAS 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46(R)). The amended standards require additional analysis of variable interest entities to determine if consolidation is necessary. The adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial statements. As required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of these standards effective January 1, 2010. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation distributes fuel oils in the United States. Proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils. If adopted, these proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards. As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 90% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA. While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court, additional significant future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred by HOVENSA over a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not expected to be material. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. 35 Table of Contents The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenditures for known sites when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2009, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately $55 million. The Corporation’s environmental assessment and remediation expenditures were approximately $11 million in each of the years 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities are sufficient for costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation anticipates capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, of approximately $50 million in 2010. Forward-Looking Information Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward-looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value-at-risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and risk management activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British pound, the Euro, and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. 36 Table of Contents • Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. • Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into formal contracts for various currencies including the British pound, the Euro and the Thai baht. At December 31, 2009 the Corporation had a payable of $16 million related to foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2010. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was also a payable of $16 million at December 31, 2009. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20% strengthening of the US dollar exchange rate is estimated to be approximately $172 million at December 31, 2009. The Corporation’s debt of $4,467 million has a fair value of $5,073 million at December 31, 2009. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $120 million at December 31, 2009.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly John B. Hess Senior Vice President and Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer Chief Executive Officer February 26, 2010 40 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and equity and comprehensive income of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young, LLP February 26, 2010 New York, New York 41 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009.

4447,HES,HESS CORP,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2010 was $2,125 million compared with $740 million in 2009 and $2,360 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share were $6.47 in 2010 compared with $2.27 in 2009 and $7.24 in 2008. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 25. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,537 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2010 compared with 1,437 million boe at December 31, 2009 and 1,432 million boe at December 31, 2008. E&P earnings were $2,736 million in 2010, $1,042 million in 2009 and $2,423 million in 2008. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $66.20 per barrel in 2010, $51.62 in 2009, and $82.04 in 2008, including the impact of hedging. Production averaged 418,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2010, an increase of 10,000 boepd or 2.5% from 2009. Production averaged 408,000 boepd in 2009, an increase of 27,000 boepd or 7% from 381,000 boepd in 2008. The Corporation estimates that total worldwide production will average between 415,000 and 425,000 boepd in 2011. The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2010: • In December, the Corporation acquired approximately 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play (Bakken) in North Dakota for $1,075 million in cash from TRZ Energy, LLC. The Corporation also completed the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc. (American Oil & Gas) through the issuance of approximately 8.6 million shares of the Corporation’s stock, which further increased its acreage position in the Bakken by approximately 85,000 net acres. After these acquisitions, the Corporation holds more than 900,000 net acres in the Bakken. The properties acquired are located near the Corporation’s existing acreage. • In September, the Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields of 28% and 25%, respectively. This non-monetary exchange, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the acquisition of an additional 8% interest in the Valhall Field and 13% interest in the Hod Field for $507 million in cash. As a result of these transactions, the Corporation’s interests in the Valhall and Hod fields increased to 64% and 63%, respectively. • In the fourth quarter, the Corporation completed the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $40 million. The Corporation now has a 40% working interest and is operator of the field. • In January, the Corporation completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia (Hess 25%) for cash proceeds of $183 million. The transaction resulted in a gain of $58 million. • In March, the Corporation agreed to the sale of its interests in a package of natural gas production and transportation assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. The package includes the Corporation’s interests in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%), the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) and the Central Area Transmission System (CATS) pipeline (Hess 18%). In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of the producing assets for approximately $350 million, 22 Table of Contents after closing adjustments. The sale of the Corporation’s interest in the CATS pipeline is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011. • In September, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge and dry hole expense totaling $554 million before income taxes ($347 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of unproved property and suspended well costs relating to its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt. • In the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia, the Corporation drilled 4 exploration wells in 2010 on WA-390-P Block (Hess 100%). The Corporation has drilled all 16 commitment wells on the block, 13 of which were natural gas discoveries. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Corporation commenced an appraisal program that includes further drilling and flow testing certain wells. • On the Pony project in Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation has signed a non-binding agreement in principle with the owners on the adjacent Green Canyon Block 512 that outlines a proposal to jointly develop the Pony and Knotty Head fields. The Corporation also spud and subsequently suspended an appraisal well on the Pony prospect in 2010. The Corporation is planning to resume drilling of the Pony appraisal well in 2011 contingent upon receipt of necessary drilling permits. • In November, the third exploration well was spud on Block BM-S-22 (Hess 40%) offshore Brazil which encountered noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. As a result, dry hole expenses totaling $111 million ($72 million after-tax) were recorded relating to this well and the previously suspended Azulão well, which was drilled in 2009. Gulf of Mexico Update: In April 2010, an accident occurred on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drilling rig at the BP p.l.c. (BP) operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in loss of life, the sinking of the rig and a significant crude oil spill. The Corporation was not a participant in the well. As a result of the accident, a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico. In October 2010, the drilling moratorium was lifted by the United States Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) provided operators complied with all rules and requirements, including a series of new drilling and safety rules issued by BOEMRE. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of these new requirements on its activities in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as seeking approvals for plans and permits submitted in connection with planned activities. However, the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs. The moratorium impacted development drilling at the Shenzi Field, in which the Corporation has a 28% interest. A production well that was being drilled was suspended and the drilling of a second production well that was planned for 2010 was postponed. The Corporation estimates that these delays reduced 2010 production by approximately 2,000 boepd and will likely reduce 2011 production by approximately 4,000 boepd. In 2010, the Corporation’s only operated drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stena Forth, left the Pony project on Green Canyon 469 as part of a preexisting agreement for a one well farm-out of the rig to another operator. In January 2011, the BOEMRE announced that supplementary environmental reviews will not be required of 13 companies to resume work on the 16 wells that were in progress when the moratorium took effect, including the aforementioned suspended Shenzi and Pony wells. However, these projects must comply with the new safety rules and regulations before work can resume. As a result, the Corporation does not anticipate that it will be able to re-commence these operations before the second half of 2011. Additionally, the Corporation has filed Suspension of Operations (SOO) applications with the BOEMRE for several exploration block licenses in the Gulf of Mexico that are due to expire in 2011 and may file additional applications as deemed necessary. These SOO applications seek approval for extension of the lease expiration terms due to circumstances outside the control of the Corporation that have delayed activities required to hold the licenses. 23 Table of Contents Marketing and Refining The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. M&R earnings (losses) were $(231) million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and $277 million in 2008. Refining operations generated losses of $445 million in 2010 and $87 million in 2009 and income of $73 million in 2008. Refining results for 2010 include an after-tax impairment charge of $289 million ($300 million pre-tax) to reduce the carrying value of the Corporation’s investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. to the estimated fair value. The refining results in 2010 and 2009 also reflect weak refining margins and lower volumes. Marketing earnings were $215 million in 2010, $168 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2008. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,530 million in 2010, $3,046 million in 2009 and $4,688 million in 2008, principally reflecting fluctuations in earnings. At December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,608 million compared with $1,362 million at December 31, 2009. Total debt was $5,583 million at December 31, 2010 compared with $4,467 million at December 31, 2009. In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1,250 million of 30 year fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% that are scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used for the acquisition of additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2010 was 24.9% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 2,935 $ 1,200 International 2,822 1,927 Total Exploration and Production 5,757 3,127 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 98 118 Total capital and exploratory expenditures $ 5,855 $ 3,245 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 154 $ 144 International 209 183 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 363 $ 327 The Corporation anticipates investing $5.6 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2011, substantially all of which relates to E&P operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 2,736 $ 1,042 $ 2,423 Marketing and Refining (231 ) 127 277 Corporate (159 ) (205 ) (173 ) Interest expense (221 ) (224 ) (167 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,125 $ 740 $ 2,360 Net income per share — diluted $ 6.47 $ 2.27 $ 7.24 24 Table of Contents The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 28 through 31. 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ 732 $ 45 $ (26 ) Marketing and Refining (289 ) 12 — Corporate (7 ) (60 ) — $ 436 $ (3 ) $ (26 ) In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s E&P operations: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 8,744 $ 6,835 $ 9,806 Other, net 1,233 207 (167 ) Total revenues and non operating income 9,977 7,042 9,639 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,924 1,805 1,872 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 865 829 725 General, administrative and other expenses 281 255 302 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,222 2,113 1,922 Asset impairments 532 54 30 Total costs and expenses 5,824 5,056 4,851 Results of operations before income taxes 4,153 1,986 4,788 Provision for income taxes 1,417 944 2,365 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,736 $ 1,042 $ 2,423 * Amounts differ from E&P operating revenues in Note 18, Segment Information, primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. After considering the E&P items in the table on page 28, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $1,775 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Lower average selling prices reduced E&P revenues by approximately $4,000 million in 2009 compared with 2008. 25 Table of Contents The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Crude oil-per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 75.02 $ 60.67 $ 96.82 Europe 58.11 47.02 78.75 Africa 65.02 48.91 78.72 Asia 79.23 63.01 97.07 Worldwide 66.20 51.62 82.04 Crude oil-per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 75.02 $ 60.67 $ 96.82 Europe 58.11 47.02 78.75 Africa 78.31 60.79 93.57 Asia 79.23 63.01 97.07 Worldwide 71.40 56.74 89.23 Natural gas liquids-per barrel United States $ 47.92 $ 36.57 $ 64.98 Europe 59.23 43.23 74.63 Asia 63.50 46.48 — Worldwide 50.49 38.47 67.61 Natural gas-per mcf (including hedging) United States $ 3.70 $ 3.36 $ 8.61 Europe 6.23 5.15 9.44 Asia and other 5.93 5.06 5.24 Worldwide 5.63 4.85 7.17 Natural gas-per mcf (excluding hedging) United States $ 3.70 $ 3.36 $ 8.61 Europe 6.23 5.15 9.79 Asia and other 5.93 5.06 5.24 Worldwide 5.63 4.85 7.30 In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedges, covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 though 2012, by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after-tax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after-tax loss from the closed positions will be approximately $330 million in 2011 and 2012. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2010 and $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. Crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced E&P earnings by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in 2008. Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 418,000 boepd in 2010 compared with 408,000 boepd in 2009 and 381,000 boepd in 2008. Approximately 73% in 2010, 72% in 2009 and 70% in 2008 of the Corporation’s production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2011 production will average between 415,000 and 425,000 boepd, after a reduction of approximately 4,000 boepd due to drilling delays at the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico as well as the effect of the sale in February 2011 of natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. 26 Table of Contents The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Crude oil (barrels per day) United States 75 60 32 Europe 88 83 83 Africa 113 120 124 Asia 13 16 13 Total 289 279 252 Natural gas liquids (barrels per day) United States 14 11 10 Europe 3 3 4 Asia 1 — — Total 18 14 14 Natural gas (mcf per day) United States 108 93 78 Europe 134 151 255 Asia and other 427 446 356 Total 669 690 689 Barrels of oil equivalent* (barrels per day) 418 408 381 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table above. United States: Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to production from the Shenzi, Llano, Conger and Bakken fields. Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi Field and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd. Europe: Crude oil production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher production in Russia and an increase in Norway following the acquisition of additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields, partially offset by lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea following the exchange of Clair for additional Norway interests. Crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008, as higher production in Russia offset lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production was lower in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to downtime at certain United Kingdom gas fields. Natural gas production was lower in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decline and subsequent cessation of production at the Atlantic and Cromarty fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of Gabon for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway in the third quarter and lower entitlement to Algerian production. Crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to lower production from the Ceiba Field. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2010 was lower than in 2009, primarily due to downtime at the Pangkah Field and a temporary shut-in at the Bumi Field in the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA). Natural gas production in 2009 was higher than in 2008, primarily due to a full year of Phase 2 sales from JDA. The decrease in crude oil production in 2010 from 2009 principally reflects changes to the Corporation’s entitlement to production in Azerbaijan. 27 Table of Contents Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $135 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and $1,030 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $145 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased by $114 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices. The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower production taxes (due to lower realized selling prices), the cessation of production at several United Kingdom North Sea fields, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the impact of higher production volumes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $109 million in 2010 and $191 million in 2009, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increases in both 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.45 in 2010, $13.70 in 2009 and $15.49 in 2008. Cash operating costs in 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $15.00 to $16.00 per barrel of oil equivalent. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.56 in 2010, $14.19 in 2009 and $13.79 in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. Effective December 31, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued updated standards for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure. The new rules allow, among other changes, the use of permitted technology in determining oil and gas reserve estimates. Since it was not practical to calculate reserve estimates under both the old and the new reserve estimation standards, it was not possible to precisely measure the effect of adopting the new SEC requirements on total proved reserves at December 31, 2009. However, the Corporation estimates that applying the new rules increased income during 2010 by approximately $80 million, after income taxes, due to lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher lease amortization. Exploration expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008, mainly due to higher dry hole costs and lease amortization. Income taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 44% in 2010, 48% in 2009 and 49% in 2008. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2011 is estimated to be in the range of 45% to 49%. Foreign Exchange: The after-tax foreign currency losses were $9 million in 2010, $10 million in 2009 and $80 million in 2008. The foreign currency loss in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses. Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Gains on asset sales $ 1,208 $ — $ — $ 1,130 $ — $ — Royalty dispute resolution — 143 — — 89 — Asset impairments (532 ) (54 ) (30 ) (334 ) (26 ) (17 ) Dry hole expense (101 ) — — (64 ) — — Reductions in carrying values of assets — (23 ) — — (18 ) — Hurricane related costs — — (15 ) — — (9 ) $ 575 $ 66 $ (45 ) $ 732 $ 45 $ (26 ) 28 Table of Contents 2010: The Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This non-monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia for a gain of $58 million. The Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Med Block, located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery, conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement. In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interests in the West Med Block. The Corporation recorded $101 million ($64 million after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and Block BM-S-22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior to 2010. 2009: The U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service (predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized after-tax income of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre-tax amount of $143 million was reported in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of $54 million ($26 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of two-short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre-tax charges of approximately $25 million ($18 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre-tax amount of most of the inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 2008: Pre-tax charges of $30 million ($17 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre-tax charges of $15 million ($9 million after income taxes) were recorded to expense costs associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico. The pre-tax amount of the charges totaling $15 million were reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation’s future E&P earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, exploration expenses, industry cost inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, the effects of weather, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. In addition, as a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the BP operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations that could impact the Corporation’s future drilling operations and increase its potential liability in the event of an oil spill. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporation’s E&P business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Marketing and Refining Earnings (losses) from M&R activities amounted to $(231) million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and $277 million in 2008. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 25 and discussed below, the earnings were $58 million, $115 million and $277 million, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Refining: Refining earnings (losses), which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results, Port Reading earnings and results of other miscellaneous operating activities, were $(445) million in 2010 (including the $289 million after-tax impairment charge discussed below), $(87) million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment) and $73 million in 2008. In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA, which was recorded in Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. The investment had been adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery utilization, and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010, HOVENSA decided to lower crude oil refining capacity from 500,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. The Corporation performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value. For discussion of the impairment charge, see Note 4, Refining Joint Venture in the notes to the financial statements on page 59. As a result of cumulative net operating losses in the last two years, the Corporation is not recognizing a full income tax benefit on the impairment charge. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results was a loss of $138 million in 2010 ($222 million before income taxes) excluding the impairment charge, a loss of $142 million ($229 million before income taxes) in 2009, and income of $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008. These results reflect lower refining margins and lower sales volumes. The 2010 and 2009 utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins and planned and unplanned maintenance. The 2008 utilization rates also reflect a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. During 2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for a scheduled turnaround. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s turnaround expenses was approximately $20 million after income taxes. Other after-tax refining results, principally from Port Reading operations, were a loss of $18 million in 2010 and income of $43 million in both 2009 and 2008. During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shutdown for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround. The after-tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround were approximately $30 million. The turnaround expenses are included in Other operating expenses, in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2010 2009 2008 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 78.0 % 80.3 % 88.2 % Fluid catalytic cracker 150 66.5 % 70.2 % 72.7 % Coker 58 78.3 % 81.6 % 92.4 % Port Reading 70 78.1 % 90.2 % 90.7 % In January 2011, HOVENSA announced plans to shut down certain older and smaller processing units on the west side of its refinery, which will reduce the refinery’s crude oil distillation capacity from 500,000 to 350,000 barrels per day, with no impact on the capacity of its coker or FCC unit. This reconfiguration, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011, is being undertaken to improve efficiency, reliability and competitiveness. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $215 million in 2010, $168 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2008. The increase in earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 reflects improved margins from the weak economic environment in 2009. 30 Table of Contents The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes: 2010 2009 2008 Refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 471 473 472 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,016 2,010 1,955 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,140 4,306 3,152 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $1 million in 2010, earnings of $46 million in 2009 and a loss of $36 million in 2008. Marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008, principally reflecting changes in retail credit card fees. The Corporation’s future M&R earnings may be impacted by supply and demand factors, volatility in margins, credit risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporation’s M&R business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 256 $ 227 $ 260 Income taxes (benefits) (104 ) (82 ) (87 ) Net corporate expenses 152 145 173 Items affecting comparability between periods, after-tax 7 60 — Total corporate expenses, after-tax $ 159 $ 205 $ 173 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflects higher employee and insurance costs, and bank facility fees. The decrease in corporate expenses in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflects gains on supplemental pension related investments and lower employee and professional costs. After-tax corporate expenses in 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $165 to $175 million. In 2009, the Corporation recorded pre-tax charges of $54 million ($34 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in fixed-rate notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $42 million ($26 million after income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. In 2010, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge of $11 million ($7 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. The pre-tax charges in connection with the debt repurchases were recorded in Other, net, and the pre-tax amounts of the retirement benefits and severance costs were recorded in General and administrative expenses within the Statement of Consolidated Income. 31 Table of Contents Interest Interest expense was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 366 $ 366 $ 274 Less capitalized interest 5 6 7 Interest expense before income taxes 361 360 267 Less income taxes 140 136 100 After-tax interest expense $ 221 $ 224 $ 167 Interest expense was comparable in 2010 and 2009. The increase in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects higher debt and fees for letters of credit. After-tax interest expense in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $240 to $250 million. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $33,862 million in 2010, $29,614 million in 2009 and $41,134 million in 2008. In 2010, sales and other operating revenues increased by 14% compared with 2009. In 2009, sales and other operating revenues decreased by 28% compared with 2008. The fluctuations in each year primarily reflect changes in crude oil and refined product selling prices. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and purchase prices of refined products, natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,608 $ 1,362 Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt $ 46 $ 148 Total debt $ 5,583 $ 4,467 Total equity $ 16,809 $ 13,528 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.9 % 24.8 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,530 $ 3,046 $ 4,688 Investing activities (5,259 ) (2,924 ) (4,444 ) Financing activities 975 332 57 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 246 $ 454 $ 301 32 Table of Contents Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $4,530 million in 2010 compared with $3,046 million in 2009, reflecting higher earnings. Operating cash flow decreased to $3,046 million in 2009 from $4,688 million in 2008 reflecting lower earnings. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 552 $ 611 $ 744 Production and development 2,592 1,927 2,523 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 2,250 262 984 5,394 2,800 4,251 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 98 118 187 Total $ 5,492 $ 2,918 $ 4,438 Capital expenditures in 2010 include acquisitions of 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. Capital expenditures in 2009 include acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A-18 of the JDA. Capital expenditures in 2008 include $600 million for leasehold acquisitions in the United States and $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the Corporation’s Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million. Financing Activities: During 2010, net proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million. In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1,250 million of 30 year fixed-rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. During 2009, net proceeds from borrowings were $447 million, compared with net repayments of debt of $32 million in 2008. Total common stock dividends paid were $131 million in 2010 and 2009 and $130 million in 2008. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $54 million, $18 million and $340 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $5.6 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2011, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. In the Corporation’s M&R operations, refining margins continue to be weak, which have adversely affected HOVENSA’s liquidity position. The Corporation intends to provide its share of financial support for HOVENSA. The Corporation expects to fund its 2011 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions, required debt repayments and financial support for HOVENSA, with existing cash on-hand, cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom natural gas assets and its available credit facilities. Crude oil prices, natural gas prices and refining margins are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and/or asset sales. 33 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2010: Expiration Letters of Available Date Capacity Borrowings Credit Issued Total Used Capacity (Millions of dollars) Revolving credit facility May 2012(a) $ 3,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,000 Asset-backed credit facility July 2011(b) 530 — 400 400 130 Committed lines Various(c) 2,925 — 1,161 1,161 1,764 Uncommitted lines Various(c) 521 — 521 521 — Total $ 6,976 $ — $ 2,082 $ 2,082 $ 4,894 (a) $75 million expires in May 2011. (b) Total capacity of $1.0 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (c) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2013. The Corporation has a $3 billion syndicated revolving credit facility (the facility), which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit, substantially all of which is committed through May 2012. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation has available capacity on the facility of $3 billion. The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2010, outstanding letters of credit under this facility were collateralized by a total of $1,194 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset-backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $22.4 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.4 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2010. The Corporation’s $2,082 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2010 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 16, Risk Management and Trading Activities. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period 2012 and 2014 and Total 2011 2013 2015 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Total debt* $ 5,583 $ 46 $ 72 $ 345 $ 5,120 Operating leases 3,077 410 840 558 1,269 Purchase obligations Supply commitments** 32,376 12,233 10,264 9,862 17 Capital expenditures and other investments 2,382 1,798 494 89 1 Operating expenses 1,677 830 483 214 150 Other long-term liabilities 2,308 204 326 310 1,468 * At December 31, 2010, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.8%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $5 billion annually using year-end 2010 prices, which have been included in the table through 2015. In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices, actual refinery output and the amount of product sold by HOVENSA to unaffiliated third parties. Under the product sales agreement between the Corporation and HOVENSA, HOVENSA is entitled to reserve refined products for sale to unaffiliated third parties each month up to a maximum amount set by the executive committee of HOVENSA annually. The Corporation is obligated to purchase 50% of the remaining refined products produced by HOVENSA, including amounts reserved for third party sales by HOVENSA that remain unsold. The prices at which the Corporation purchases refined products are determined by reference to published market prices prevailing at the time of purchase. The amount of the purchase commitment from HOVENSA is based on the forecasted refinery output that is expected to be sold to the Corporation calculated using year-end prices. Also included above are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year-end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporation’s planned $5.6 billion capital investment program for 2011 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2010. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. As of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2012, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $190 million. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2010 it amounted to $150 million. In addition, the Corporation 35 Table of Contents has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2010 as shown below (in millions): Letters of credit $ 81 Guarantees 165 $ 246 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $394 million at December 31, 2010 compared with $412 million at December 31, 2009. The Corporation’s December 31, 2010 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 24.9% to 26.2% if these leases were included as debt. See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 17, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. 36 Table of Contents Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year-end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation’s goodwill is assigned to the E&P operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the E&P segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential 37 Table of Contents synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the E&P segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the E&P segment. Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Differences between the carrying value of the Corporation’s equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliate’s fixed assets. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure the fair value of financial asset and liabilities based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal 38 Table of Contents trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s balance sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. 39 Table of Contents The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporation’s financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Changes in Accounting Policies Effective January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted the amended accounting standards that eliminated the consolidation exception for a qualifying special-purpose entity and changed the analysis necessary to determine whether consolidation of a variable interest entity is required. The adoption of these standards resulted in an increase of approximately $10 million to Property, plant and equipment and a corresponding increase to Long-term debt. The debt was subsequently repaid during the first quarter of 2010. Effective December 31, 2009, the FASB adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) Extractive Activities — Oil and Gas (ASC 932) Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures, which amended the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The main provisions of the ASU, which align accounting standards with the previously issued Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements, expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the year-end price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these disclosures. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate 40 Table of Contents regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation distributes fuel oils in the United States. Many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions. These proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils. Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a Consent Decree with EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, HOVENSA will pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority with monitoring. The Consent Decree has been lodged with the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands and approval is pending. In addition, substantial progress has been made towards resolving this matter for the Port Reading refining facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation’s financial position or results of operations. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2010, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $55 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was $13 million in 2010 and $11 million in both 2009 and 2008. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were approximately $85 million in 2010, $50 million in 2009 and $15 million in 2008. Forward-Looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Business and Properties, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward-looking information. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the 41 Table of Contents future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporation’s results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and risk management activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. 42 Table of Contents • Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed-rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into formal contracts for various currencies including the British Pound and the Thai Baht. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2011 with a fair value of $7 million. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the US Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be an approximately $88 million loss at December 31, 2010. The Corporation’s fixed-rate debt of $5,569 million has a fair value of $6,353 million at December 31, 2010. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $147 million at December 31, 2010.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By By John P. Rielly John B. Hess Senior Vice President and Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer Chief Executive Officer February 25, 2011 46 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and equity and comprehensive income of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

4447,HES,HESS CORP,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2011 was $1,703 million compared with $2,125 million in 2010 and $740 million in 2009. Diluted earnings per share were $5.01 in 2011 compared with $6.47 in 2010 and $2.27 in 2009. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 23. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,573 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2011 compared with 1,537 million boe at December 31, 2010 and 1,437 million boe at December 31, 2009. E&P earnings were $2,675 million in 2011, $2,736 million in 2010 and $1,042 million in 2009. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $89.99 per barrel in 2011, $66.20 in 2010 and $51.62 in 2009, including the impact of hedging. Average realized natural gas selling prices were $5.96 per mcf in 2011, $5.63 in 2010 and $4.85 in 2009. Production averaged 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2011, a decrease of 48,000 boepd or 11% from 2010. Production averaged 408,000 boepd in 2009. The Corporation estimates that total worldwide production will average between 370,000 and 390,000 boepd in 2012, excluding the impact of asset sales and any Libyan production. The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2011: • In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged approximately 30,000 boepd during 2011 and 38,000 boepd for the fourth quarter 2011. The Corporation forecasts Bakken production will average 60,000 boepd for the full year of 2012 and is targeted to reach 120,000 boepd in 2015. • The Corporation and its partner sanctioned the development of the Tubular Bells Field (Hess 57%) in the Mississippi Canyon Block 725 Area in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In 2012, field development will be advanced with the construction of a floating production system and development drilling is scheduled to start in the second quarter. First production is anticipated in 2014. • In the third quarter of the year, the Corporation announced the acquisition of approximately 185,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio. The Corporation entered into agreements to acquire approximately 85,000 net acres for approximately $750 million, principally through the acquisition of Marquette Exploration, LLC. In October 2011, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 50% undivided interest in CONSOL Energy Inc.’s (CONSOL) nearly 200,000 acres in the Utica Shale play for $59 million in cash at closing and the agreement to fund 50% of CONSOL’s share of the drilling costs up to $534 million within a 5-year period. Appraisal of the Utica acreage commenced in the fourth quarter and will continue during 2012 with the acquisition of seismic and the planned drilling of 29 wells. • The Corporation filed a Notice of Discovery with the Ministry for Energy of Ghana for the Paradise-1 exploration well in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block. The well encountered an estimated 490 net feet of oil and gas condensate pay over three separate intervals. The Corporation is operator and has a 90% working interest in the license. The Corporation anticipates commencing additional exploration drilling in the first quarter of 2012, subject to government approvals and rig availability. • In 2011, the Corporation drilled the Andalan-1 well on the Semai V block, offshore Indonesia (Hess 100%). The well encountered reservoir sands and hydrocarbons but not in commercial quantities. This well, along with a follow up well, was expensed in the fourth quarter. In September 2011, the operator of Block CA-1 in Brunei (Hess 14%) spud the Julong Center well. This well also failed to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was expensed. 21 Table of Contents • In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in certain natural gas producing assets located in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post-closing adjustments, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post-closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in non-taxable gains totaling $103 million. Status of Libyan Operations In response to civil unrest in Libya, a number of measures were taken by the international community in the first quarter of 2011, including the imposition of economic sanctions. Production at the Waha Field was suspended in the first quarter of 2011. As a consequence of the civil unrest and the sanctions, the Corporation delivered force majeure notices to the Libyan government relating to the agreements covering its exploration and production interests in order to protect its rights while it was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its obligations and benefiting from the rights granted by those agreements. Production at the Waha Field restarted during the fourth quarter of 2011 at levels that were significantly lower than those prior to the civil unrest. The Corporation’s Libyan production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for the full year of 2010 and 4,000 boepd for 2011. The force majeure covering the Corporation’s production interests was withdrawn at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, as the economic sanctions were lifted. The force majeure covering the Corporation’s offshore exploration interests remained in place at year-end but is expected to be withdrawn in 2012. The Corporation had proved reserves of 166 million barrels of oil equivalent in Libya at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, the net book value of the Corporation’s exploration and production assets in Libya was approximately $500 million. Marketing and Refining The Corporation’s strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver strong operating performance and generate free cash flow. In January 2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to shut down its refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands and operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. Results from M&R activities amounted to losses of $584 million in 2011, losses of $231 million in 2010 and earnings of $127 million in 2009. Refining operations generated losses of $728 million in 2011, $445 million in 2010 and $87 million in 2009. Refining results include after-tax charges of $525 million in 2011 and $289 million in 2010 related to the Corporation’s investment in HOVENSA. Marketing earnings were $185 million in 2011, $215 million in 2010 and $168 million in 2009. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,984 million in 2011, $4,530 million in 2010 and $3,046 million in 2009. At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $351 million compared with $1,608 million at December 31, 2010, principally due to increased capital expenditures. Total debt was $6,057 million at December 31, 2011 and $5,583 million at December 31, 2010. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2011 was 24.6% compared with 24.9% at the end of 2010. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 4,305 $ 2,935 $ 1,200 International 3,039 2,822 1,927 Total Exploration and Production 7,344 5,757 3,127 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 98 118 Total capital and exploratory expenditures $ 7,462 $ 5,855 $ 3,245 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 197 $ 154 $ 144 International 259 209 183 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 456 $ 363 $ 327 22 Table of Contents The Corporation anticipates investing $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2012, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars,except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 2,675 $ 2,736 $ 1,042 Marketing and Refining (584 ) (231 ) 127 Corporate (154 ) (159 ) (205 ) Interest expense (234 ) (221 ) (224 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 1,703 $ 2,125 $ 740 Net income per share — diluted $ 5.01 $ 6.47 $ 2.27 The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 27 through 30. 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ 244 $ 732 $ 45 Marketing and Refining (525 ) (289 ) 12 Corporate — (7 ) (60 ) $ (281 ) $ 436 $ (3 ) In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. 23 Table of Contents Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s E&P operations for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 10,047 $ 8,744 $ 6,835 Other, net 464 1,233 207 Total revenues and non operating income 10,511 9,977 7,042 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 2,352 1,924 1,805 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 1,195 865 829 General, administrative and other expenses 313 281 255 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,305 2,222 2,113 Asset impairments 358 532 54 Total costs and expenses 6,523 5,824 5,056 Results of operations before income taxes 3,988 4,153 1,986 Provision for income taxes 1,313 1,417 944 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,675 $ 2,736 $ 1,042 * Amounts differ from E&P operating revenues in Note 19, Segment Information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. After considering the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 27, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, income taxes and foreign exchange, as discussed below. Selling Prices: Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $2,400 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $1,775 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Crude oil — per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 98.56 $ 75.02 $ 60.67 Europe 80.18 58.11 47.02 Africa 88.46 65.02 48.91 Asia 111.71 79.23 63.01 Worldwide 89.99 66.20 51.62 Crude oil — per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 98.56 $ 75.02 $ 60.67 Europe 80.18 58.11 47.02 Africa 110.28 78.31 60.79 Asia 111.71 79.23 63.01 Worldwide 95.60 71.40 56.74 Natural gas liquids — per barrel United States $ 58.59 $ 47.92 $ 36.57 Europe 75.49 59.23 43.23 Asia 72.29 63.50 46.48 Worldwide 62.72 50.49 38.47 24 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2009 Natural gas — per mcf United States $ 3.39 $ 3.70 $ 3.36 Europe 8.79 6.23 5.15 Asia and other 6.02 5.93 5.06 Worldwide 5.96 5.63 4.85 In October 2008, the Corporation closed Brent crude oil hedges covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after-tax losses as of the date the hedge positions were closed are recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by $327 million ($517 million before income taxes) in 2011, $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2010 and $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. The remaining realized after-tax losses from the closed hedge positions will be approximately $325 million in 2012. The Corporation also entered into Brent crude oil hedges using fixed-price swap contracts to hedge 120,000 boepd of crude oil sales volumes for the full year of 2012 at an average price of $107.70 per barrel. Production and Sales Volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 370,000 boepd in 2011 compared with 418,000 boepd in 2010 and 408,000 boepd in 2009. The principal reasons for the reduction are described below. Approximately 72% in 2011, 73% in 2010 and 72% in 2009 of the Corporation’s production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2012 production will average between 370,000 and 390,000 boepd, excluding the impact of asset sales and any Libyan production. The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Crude oil — barrels per day United States 81 75 60 Europe 89 88 83 Africa 66 113 120 Asia 13 13 16 Total 249 289 279 Natural gas liquids — barrels per day United States 13 14 11 Europe 3 3 3 Asia 1 1 — Total 17 18 14 Natural gas — mcf per day United States 100 108 93 Europe 81 134 151 Asia and other 442 427 446 Total 623 669 690 Barrels of oil equivalent — per day* 370 418 408 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table above. 25 Table of Contents United States: Crude oil production in the United States was higher in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to new wells in the Bakken oil shale play, partly offset by lower production due to a shut-in well at the Llano Field. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to this shut-in well at the Llano Field. Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi, Llano, Conger and Bakken fields. Europe: Crude oil production was comparable in 2011 and 2010, as higher production from Russia was largely offset by lower production from the Corporation’s United Kingdom North Sea assets. Crude oil production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher production in Russia and in Norway following the acquisition of additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in 2010. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to the sale in February 2011 of certain natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production was lower in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to downtime at certain United Kingdom gas fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the suspension of production in Libya following civil unrest, the exchange in September 2010 of the Corporation’s interests in Gabon for increased interests in Norway, lower production entitlement in Equatorial Guinea and Algeria as a result of higher selling prices, and natural decline in Equatorial Guinea. Crude oil production decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of Gabon for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway and lower entitlement to Algerian production. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2011 was higher than 2010, primarily due to higher total nominations at the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) and the adjacent Block PM301 in Malaysia and first production from the Gajah Baru Complex at the Natuna A Field in Indonesia, which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011. Natural gas production in 2010 was lower than in 2009, primarily due to downtime at the Pangkah Field in Indonesia and a temporary shut-in at the Bumi Field in the JDA. Sales Volumes: Lower sales volumes and other operating revenues decreased revenue by approximately $1,100 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by $135 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Operating Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $460 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and increased by $145 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices, together with higher operating and maintenance expenses, mainly in Norway and in the Bakken oil shale play. The increase in costs in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $83 million in 2011 and $109 million in 2010, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increases in both 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. In addition, the higher total per barrel costs in 2011 resulted from a greater proportion of production volumes from the Bakken. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $19.71 in 2011, $14.45 in 2010 and $13.70 in 2009. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $17.06 in 2011, $14.56 in 2010 and $14.19 in 2009. For 2012, cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.00 to $21.00 per barrel and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel, resulting in total unit costs in the range of $40.50 to $42.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libyan operations. Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010, mainly due to higher dry hole expenses. Dry hole expenses included amounts relating to two exploration wells on the Semai V Block, offshore Indonesia and a well in the North Red Sea Block 1, offshore Egypt. Exploration expenses also increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher lease amortization. Income Taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 38% in 2011, 44% in 2010 and 48% in 2009. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2011 compared with 2010 was predominantly due to the suspension of Libyan operations. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2012 is estimated to be in the range of 36% to 40%, excluding Libyan operations. 26 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange: The after-tax foreign currency losses were $16 million in 2011, $9 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes for the years ended December 31: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Gains on asset sales $ 446 $ 1,208 $ — $ 413 $ 1,130 $ — Royalty dispute resolution — — 143 — — 89 Asset impairments (358 ) (532 ) (54 ) (140 ) (334 ) (26 ) Dry hole expense — (101 ) — — (64 ) — Reductions in carrying values of assets — — (23 ) — — (18 ) Income tax adjustment — — — (29 ) — — $ 88 $ 575 $ 66 $ 244 $ 732 $ 45 2011: In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%) and the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post-closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in pre-tax gains totaling $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). These assets had a productive capacity of approximately 15,000 boepd. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $16 million, including allocated goodwill of $14 million. In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post-closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in non-taxable gains totaling $103 million. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $28 million, including allocated goodwill of $11 million. In the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation recorded impairment charges of $358 million ($140 million after income taxes) related to increases in the Corporation’s estimated abandonment liabilities primarily for non-producing properties which resulted in the book value of the properties exceeding their fair value. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2011, the United Kingdom increased the supplementary tax rate on petroleum operations to 32% from 20% with an effective date of March 24, 2011. As a result, the Corporation recorded a charge of $29 million to increase the deferred tax liability in the United Kingdom. 2010: The Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This non-monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia for a gain of $58 million. The Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery, conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement. In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interest in the West Med Block. The West Med Block was relinquished in 2011. The Corporation also recorded $101 million ($64 million after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and Block BM-S-22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior to 2010. 27 Table of Contents 2009: The U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service (predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized after-tax income of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre-tax amount of $143 million was reported in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of $54 million ($26 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of two-short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre-tax charges of approximately $23 million ($18 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre-tax amount of most of the inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation’s future E&P earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, exploration expenses, industry cost inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, the effects of weather, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. In addition, as a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the BP p.l.c. operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations that could impact the Corporation’s future drilling operations and increase its potential liability in the event of an oil spill. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporation’s E&P business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Marketing and Refining Results from M&R activities were losses of $584 million in 2011, losses of $231 million in 2010 and earnings of $127 million in 2009. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 23 and discussed below, results were losses of $59 million in 2011 and earnings of $58 million in 2010 and $115 million in 2009. Refining: Refining results consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s losses, together with the results of Port Reading and other miscellaneous operating activities. Refining losses were $728 million in 2011 (including $525 million of after-tax losses related to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges due to the decision to shut down the refinery in St. Croix), $445 million in 2010 (including a $289 million after-tax charge to reduce the carrying value of the Corporation’s equity investment in HOVENSA) and $87 million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment). In 2011, HOVENSA experienced continued substantial operating losses due to global economic conditions and competitive disadvantages versus other refiners, despite efforts to improve operating performance by reducing refining capacity to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of the year. Operating losses were also projected to continue. In January 2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to shut down its refinery and operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. As a result of these developments, HOVENSA prepared an impairment analysis as of December 31, 2011, which concluded that undiscounted future cash flows would not recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets, and recorded an impairment charge and other charges related to the decision to shut down the refinery. For 2011, the Corporation recorded a total of $1,073 million of losses from its equity investment in HOVENSA. These pre-tax losses included $875 million ($525 million after income taxes) due to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges associated with its decision to shut down the refinery. The Corporation’s share of the impairment related losses recorded by HOVENSA represents an amount equivalent to the Corporation’s financial support to HOVENSA at December 31, 2011, its planned future funding commitments for costs related to the refinery shutdown, and a charge of $135 million for the write-off of related assets held by the subsidiary which owns the Corporation’s investment in HOVENSA. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation has a liability of $487 million for its planned funding commitments, which is expected to be incurred in 2012. A deferred income tax benefit of $350 million, consisting primarily of U.S. income taxes, has been recorded on the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s impairment and refinery shutdown related charges. 28 Table of Contents In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA, which was recorded in Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C., on the Statement of Consolidated Income. The investment had been adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery utilization, and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010, HOVENSA decided to lower its crude oil refining capacity to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in 2011. The Corporation performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value. For discussion of the impairment charge, see Note 5, HOVENSA L.L.C. Joint Venture in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding items affecting comparability discussed above, the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results was a loss of $198 million in 2011, $137 million in 2010 ($222 million before income taxes) and $141 million ($230 million before income taxes) in 2009. U.S. Virgin Island income taxes have not been recorded on the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s 2011 results due to cumulative operating losses. These results reflect lower refining margins, higher fuel costs and lower sales volumes. During 2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for a scheduled turnaround. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s turnaround expenses was approximately $20 million after income taxes. Other after-tax refining results, principally from Port Reading operations, were a loss of $5 million in 2011, a loss of $19 million in 2010 and income of $42 million in 2009. During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround. The after-tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround were approximately $30 million. The turnaround expenses are included in Other operating expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates for the years ended December 31: RefineryCapacity Refinery Utilization (Thousands ofbarrels per day) 2011 2010 2009 HOVENSA Crude 350* 81.1 % 78.0 % 80.3 % Fluid catalytic cracker 150 71.7 % 66.5 % 70.2 % Coker 58 77.4 % 78.3 % 81.6 % Port Reading 70 90.0 % 78.1 % 90.2 % * HOVENSA’s crude oil refining capacity was reduced to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2011. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $185 million in 2011, $215 million in 2010 and $168 million in 2009. The decrease in earnings in 2011 compared with 2010 was due to lower sales volumes and lower margins. The increase in earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 reflected improved margins from the weak economic environment in 2009. The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Refined petroleum product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 430 471 473 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,167 2,016 2,010 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,374 4,140 4,306 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $41 million in 2011, a loss of $1 million in 2010 and earnings of $46 million in 2009. Marketing expenses increased in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting higher retail credit card fees, maintenance, environmental and employee related expenses. Marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared with 2009, principally reflecting changes in retail credit card fees. 29 Table of Contents The Corporation’s future M&R earnings may be impacted by supply and demand factors, volatility in margins, credit risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporation’s M&R business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 260 $ 256 $ 227 Income taxes (benefits) (106 ) (104 ) (82 ) Net corporate expenses 154 152 145 Items affecting comparability between periods, after-tax — 7 60 Total corporate expenses, after-tax $ 154 $ 159 $ 205 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, net corporate expenses were comparable in 2011 and 2010. The increase in net corporate expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflects higher employee and insurance costs and bank facility fees. After-tax corporate expenses in 2012 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. In 2010, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge of $11 million ($7 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of fixed-rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. In 2009, the Corporation recorded pre-tax charges of $54 million ($34 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in fixed-rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $42 million ($26 million after income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. The pre-tax charges in connection with the debt repurchases were recorded in Other, net, and the pre-tax amounts of the retirement benefits and severance costs were recorded in General and administrative expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Interest Interest expense was as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 396 $ 366 $ 366 Capitalized interest (13 ) (5 ) (6 ) Interest expense before income taxes 383 361 360 Income taxes (benefits) (149 ) (140 ) (136 ) After-tax interest expense $ 234 $ 221 $ 224 The increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects higher average borrowings following the issuance of $1.25 billion of 30-year fixed-rate public notes in August 2010. Capitalized interest increased in 2011 due to the sanctioning of the Tubular Bells project. Interest expense was comparable in 2010 and 2009. After-tax interest expense in 2012 is expected to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million. Consolidated Sales and Cost of Products Sold Sales and other operating revenues totaled $38,466 million in 2011, $33,862 million in 2010 and $29,614 million in 2009. The increase in Sales and other operating revenues of 14% year-on-year from 2009 to 2011 is primarily due to higher crude oil and refined petroleum product selling prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and refined petroleum product sales volumes. 30 Table of Contents The increase in Cost of products sold each year principally reflects higher prices for purchased refined petroleum products. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 351 $ 1,608 Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt $ 52 $ 46 Total debt $ 6,057 $ 5,583 Total equity $ 18,592 $ 16,809 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.6 % 24.9 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,984 $ 4,530 $ 3,046 Investing activities (6,566 ) (5,259 ) (2,924 ) Financing activities 325 975 332 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,257 ) $ 246 $ 454 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4,984 million in 2011 compared with $4,530 million in 2010, reflecting higher operating earnings partially offset by a period over period increase in the use of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $412 million. Operating cash flow increased to $4,530 million in 2010 from $3,046 million in 2009 principally reflecting higher earnings. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 869 $ 552 $ 611 Production and development 4,673 2,592 1,927 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 1,346 2,250 262 6,888 5,394 2,800 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 98 118 Total $ 7,006 $ 5,492 $ 2,918 Capital expenditures in 2011 included acquisitions of approximately $800 million for 185,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio, $214 million for interests in two blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and $116 million for an additional 4% interest in the South Arne Field in Denmark. Capital expenditures in 2010 included acquisitions of 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. Capital expenditures in 2009 included acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A-18 of the JDA. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $490 million in 2011 and $183 million in 2010. 31 Table of Contents Financing Activities: During 2011, net proceeds from borrowings on available credit facilities were $422 million. During 2010, net proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million, including the August 2010 issuance of $1,250 million of 30-year fixed-rate public notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of fixed-rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. Total common stock dividends paid were $136 million in 2011 and $131 million in 2010 and 2009. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $88 million, $54 million and $18 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2012, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. The Corporation expects to fund its 2012 operations, including capital expenditures, its share of HOVENSA financial support totaling $487 million, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand, cash flows from operations including the effect of hedging, proceeds from asset sales and its available credit facilities. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and/or asset sales. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2011: ExpirationDate Capacity Borrowings Letters ofCredit Issued Total Used AvailableCapacity (Millions of dollars) Revolving credit facility April 2016 $ 4,000 $ — $ 173 $ 173 $ 3,827 Asset-backed credit facility July 2012 (a) 525 350 — 350 175 Committed lines Various (b) 2,675 — 1,063 1,063 1,612 Uncommitted lines Various (b) 562 100 462 562 — Total $ 7,762 $ 450 $ 1,698 $ 2,148 $ 5,614 (a) Total capacity of $1 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (b) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2014. In April 2011, the Corporation entered into a new $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in April 2016. This facility, which replaced a $3 billion facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2012, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility bear interest at 1.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of 0.25% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The covenants that establish restrictions on the amount of total borrowings and secured debt are consistent with the previous facility. The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2011, outstanding borrowings under this facility of $350 million were collateralized by a total of $947 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset-backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Promptly after filing this report, as a result 32 Table of Contents of the Corporation’s existing shelf registration expiring on February 26, 2012, the Corporation anticipates filing a new shelf registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which it may issue, among other things, additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $24.9 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.5 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2011. The Corporation’s $1.7 billion in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2011 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 17, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period Total 2012 2013 and2014 2015 and2016 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Total debt* $ 6,057 $ 52 $ 386 $ 459 $ 5,160 Operating leases 3,210 531 1,195 320 1,164 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 8,131 7,187 782 149 13 Capital expenditures and other investments 3,045 1,640 873 257 275 Operating expenses 3,039 1,637 829 204 369 Other long-term liabilities 3,327 290 556 463 2,018 * At December 31, 2011, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.8%. Supply commitments include term purchase agreements at market prices for a portion of the gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year-end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporation’s planned $6.8 billion capital investment program for 2012 that was contractually committed at December 31, 2011. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. During 2011, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a floating production system and related support activities for the Tubular Bells Field. Payments under this five year contract, which total approximately $420 million and are expected to commence by mid-2014, are included in Capital expenditures and other investments in the contractual obligations table above. The Corporation also has a tolling agreement with Bayonne Energy Center, LLC (BEC) (Hess 50%), a joint venture formed to generate electricity for sale into the 33 Table of Contents New York City market. Under the tolling arrangement, the Corporation will pay its share of a predetermined monthly amount to BEC following the start up of plant operations, which is expected in mid-2012. Estimated payments through 2027, which total approximately $415 million, are included in Operating expenses in the contractual obligations table. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture. This contingent obligation, which expires in April 2014, was approximately $205 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2011 as shown below (in millions of dollars): Letters of credit $ 67 Guarantees 15 $ 82 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $388 million at December 31, 2011 compared with $394 million at December 31, 2010. If these leases were included as debt, the Corporation’s December 31, 2011 debt to capitalization ratio would increase to 25.7% from 24.6%. See also Note 18, Guarantees and Contingencies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 34 Table of Contents (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year-end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves. Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below, there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level 35 Table of Contents below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation has concluded that the E&P segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, since the E&P segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level. Accordingly, the Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment. If any of the E&P segment components, such as our financial reporting regions (United States, Europe, Africa and Asia) were considered to be reporting units, an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill (ASC 350-20-35). If components are economically similar, that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. While the Corporation believes that the E&P segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed, it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting (ASC 280-10-50-11) and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons: • The Corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single, global business. • Each component produces oil and gas. • The exploration and production processes are similar in each component. • The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar. • Customers of each component are similar. • The components share technical resources and support services. If the Corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit, goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the E&P segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar E&P companies. The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the E&P segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the E&P segment. Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Differences between the carrying value of the Corporation’s equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliate’s fixed assets. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain 36 Table of Contents assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporation’s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporation’s crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum 37 Table of Contents products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy-related commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporation’s financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. 38 Table of Contents Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values-based, socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. Over the last several years, many refineries have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with the New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a consent decree with the EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, HOVENSA agreed to pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority with monitoring. However, as a result of HOVENSA’s decision to shut down its refinery, which was announced in January 2012, HOVENSA believes that it will not be required to make material capital expenditures pursuant to this consent decree. The Corporation believes that it will also enter into a consent decree with the EPA in the near future to resolve these matters as they relate to its Port Reading refinery facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Corporation. The Corporation produces and distributes fuel oils in the United States. Many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions. These proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation for its Port Reading refining facility to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils and affect the profitability of that facility. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2011, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $60 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was $19 million in 2011, $13 million in 2010 and $11 million in 2009. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were approximately $95 million in 2011, $85 million in 2010 and $50 million in 2009. 39 Table of Contents Forward-looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Business and Properties, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward-looking information. These sections typically include statements with words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “guidance”, “could”, “may”, “should”, “would” or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporation’s results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy-related commodities, securities and derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. 40 Table of Contents • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. • Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy-related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined petroleum products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed-rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies, including the British Pound and the Thai Baht. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2012 with a fair value of $14 million. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $89 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation’s outstanding long-term debt of $6,040 million has a fair value of $7,317 million at December 31, 2011. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $247 million at December 31, 2011. Following is the value at risk for the Corporation’s energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities, excluding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives described above: 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) At December 31 $ 94 $ 5 Average 30 5 High 94 6 Low 8 4 The increase in the value at risk for the Corporation’s energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities in 2011 primarily reflects additional Brent crude oil cash flow hedge positions as described in Note 17, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading Activities Trading activities are conducted principally through a trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest. This consolidated entity intends to generate earnings through various strategies primarily using energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. 41 Table of Contents Following is the value at risk for the Corporation’s trading activities: 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) At December 31 $ 4 $ 14 Average 11 14 High 16 15 Low 4 12 The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer February 27, 2012 44 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hess Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries, and our report dated February 27, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG, LLP February 27, 2012 New York, New York 45 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, and equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Hess Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Corporation or Hess) operate in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The Corporation has made significant progress in its transformation from an integrated oil and gas company to a predominantly E&P company following the shutdown of the HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA) joint venture refinery in January 2012, and its decision in January 2013 to cease refining operations at its Port Reading facility and pursue the sale of its terminal network. Following these actions, over 90 percent of the Corporation’s capital employed will be in its E&P segment. The Corporation also has shifted its E&P growth strategy from one based primarily on high impact exploration to one based on a combination of the development of unconventional resources, exploitation of existing discoveries and a smaller, more focused exploratory program. The Corporation intends to continue to pursue its strategy of transforming itself into an essentially E&P business focused on the Corporation’s most promising properties and operations. On January 29, 2013, Elliott Management Corporation (Elliott) sent a letter to Hess shareholders informing them that affiliates of Elliott beneficially own 4 percent of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation and are nominating five individuals for election as directors at the Corporation’s 2013 Annual Meeting. Among other things, Elliott stated its view that Hess should (1) spin off the Corporation’s Bakken assets along with the Eagle Ford and Utica acreage; (2) divest the Corporation’s downstream assets and place midstream assets into a master limited partnership (MLP) or real estate investment trust (REIT) structure; and (3) divest assets from the Corporation’s remaining international portfolio. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing Elliott’s proposals with the Board and its advisors and intends to respond in the near future. Net income in 2012 was $2,025 million compared with $1,703 million in 2011 and $2,125 million in 2010. Diluted earnings per share were $5.95 in 2012 compared with $5.01 in 2011 and $6.47 in 2010. A table of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods is shown on page 22. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,553 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2012 compared with 1,573 million boe at December 31, 2011 and 1,537 million boe at December 31, 2010. E&P earnings were $2,212 million in 2012, $2,675 million in 2011 and $2,736 million in 2010. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, E&P net income was $2,256 million, $2,431 million and $2,004 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $86.94 per barrel in 2012, $89.99 in 2011 and $66.20 in 2010, including the impact of hedging. Average realized natural gas selling prices were $6.16 per mcf in 2012, $5.96 in 2011 and $5.63 in 2010. Production averaged 406,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2012, 370,000 boepd in 2011 and 418,000 boepd in 2010. The Corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 375,000 boepd and 390,000 boepd in 2013. This forecast assumes Russian operations remain in the portfolio for the full year. The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2012: • In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged 56,000 boepd during 2012, an increase of 87% from 30,000 boepd in 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Corporation substantially completed “held by production” drilling in the Bakken and is transitioning to pad drilling, which involves sequentially drilling a number of wells on a pad followed by sequential completion of the wells. This pad drilling process is expected to lead to a temporary flattening of the Bakken production profile until mid-2013. Bakken production is expected to average between 64,000 boepd and 70,000 boepd for the full year of 2013, with most of the increase from 2012 expected to occur in the second half of the year. • At the Valhall Field, a multi-year redevelopment project was advanced in 2012 and completed in early 2013. The project included the installation of a new production, utilities and accommodation platform and expansion of gross production capacity to 120,000 barrels of liquids per day and 143,000 mcf of natural gas per day. In July 2012, the field was shut-in to complete the installation and commissioning of the new facilities and production resumed in January 2013. • The Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Schiehallion Field (Hess 16%), the Bittern Field (Hess 28%) and related assets in the United Kingdom North Sea, and the Snohvit Field (Hess 3%), offshore Norway, for total cash proceeds of $843 million. These transactions resulted in pre-tax gains totaling $584 million ($557 million after income taxes). These assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 15,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 83 million boe of proved reserves. 20 Table of Contents • In October, the Corporation also announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its interests in the Beryl fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. These assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 15,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 21 million boe of proved reserves. The sale was completed in January 2013 for cash proceeds of approximately $440 million. • In September, the Corporation reached an agreement to sell its interests in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields (Hess 3%) in Azerbaijan and its interest in the associated Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline (Hess 2%) for approximately $1 billion, subject to normal closing adjustments. The transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013, is subject to government and regulatory approvals. • In June, the Corporation signed agreements with its partner to develop nine discovered natural gas fields in the North Malay Basin, located offshore Peninsular Malaysia. The Corporation will have a 50% interest and is the operator. First production is forecast to commence from an early production system in the second half of 2013. • During the third quarter of 2012, the Corporation signed an exchange agreement with the partners of Green Canyon Block 512 that contains the Knotty Head discovery and is in the same reservoir as the Corporation’s Pony discovery on the adjacent Block 468. Under this agreement, the Corporation was appointed operator and has a 20% working interest in the blocks, now collectively referred to as Stampede. Field development planning is progressing and the project is targeted for sanction in 2014. • During the year, the Corporation completed four successful exploration wells on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block, offshore Ghana. In early 2013, the Corporation completed two additional successful wells, resulting in a total of seven consecutive successful exploration wells. Based on the results of these wells, the Corporation plans to submit an appraisal plan to the Ghanaian government for approval on or before June 2, 2013. In parallel, the Corporation has begun pre-development studies on the block. Marketing and Refining Results from M&R activities were earnings of $231 million in 2012, a loss of $584 million in 2011 and a loss of $231 million in 2010. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, M&R earnings were $160 million in 2012, a loss of $59 million in 2011 and earnings of $58 million in 2010. In January 2012, HOVENSA shut down its refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The Corporation and its joint venture partner plan to pursue the sale of HOVENSA, while the complex is operated as an oil storage terminal. In January 2013, the Corporation announced its decision to cease refining operations in February at its Port Reading facility and pursue the sale of its terminal network. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $5,660 million in 2012, $4,984 million in 2011 and $4,530 million in 2010. At December 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $642 million, an increase from $351 million at December 31, 2011. Total debt was $8,111 million at December 31, 2012 and $6,057 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2012 was 27.7% compared with 24.6% at the end of 2011. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Exploration and Production United States $ 4,763 $ 4,305 $ 2,935 International 3,383 3,039 2,822 Total Exploration and Production 8,146 7,344 5,757 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 119 118 98 Total capital and exploratory expenditures $ 8,265 $ 7,462 $ 5,855 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 142 $ 197 $ 154 International 328 259 209 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 470 $ 456 $ 363 The Corporation anticipates investing $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2013, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. 21 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions, except per share amounts) Exploration and Production $ 2,212 $ 2,675 $ 2,736 Marketing and Refining 231 (584 ) (231 ) Corporate (158 ) (154 ) (159 ) Interest expense (260 ) (234 ) (221 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,025 $ 1,703 $ 2,125 Net income per share — diluted $ 5.95 $ 5.01 $ 6.47 The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 25 through 27. 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Exploration and Production $ (44 ) $ 244 $ 732 Marketing and Refining 71 (525 ) (289 ) Corporate — — (7 ) $ 27 $ (281 ) $ 436 In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s E&P operations: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 10,893 $ 10,047 $ 8,744 Gains on asset sales 584 446 1,208 Other, net 99 18 25 Total revenues and non-operating income 11,576 10,511 9,977 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 2,752 2,352 1,924 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 1,070 1,195 865 General, administrative and other expenses 314 313 281 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,853 2,305 2,222 Asset impairments 582 358 532 Total costs and expenses 7,571 6,523 5,824 Results of operations before income taxes 4,005 3,988 4,153 Provision for income taxes 1,793 1,313 1,417 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,212 $ 2,675 $ 2,736 * Amounts differ from E&P operating revenues in Note 18, Segment Information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. 22 Table of Contents After considering the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 25, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, operating costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling Prices: Lower average realized selling prices, primarily from crude oil and natural gas liquids, decreased E&P revenues by approximately $380 million in 2012 compared with the corresponding period in 2011. Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $2,400 million in 2011 compared with 2010. The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Crude oil — per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 92.32 $ 98.56 $ 75.02 Europe 74.14 80.18 58.11 Africa 89.02 88.46 65.02 Asia 107.45 111.71 79.23 Worldwide 86.94 89.99 66.20 Crude oil — per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 93.96 $ 98.56 $ 75.02 Europe 75.06 80.18 58.11 Africa 110.92 110.28 78.31 Asia 109.35 111.71 79.23 Worldwide 93.70 95.60 71.40 Natural gas liquids — per barrel United States $ 40.75 $ 58.59 $ 47.92 Europe 78.43 75.49 59.23 Asia 77.92 72.29 63.50 Worldwide 47.81 62.72 50.49 Natural gas — per mcf United States $ 2.09 $ 3.39 $ 3.70 Europe 9.50 8.79 6.23 Asia and other 6.90 6.02 5.93 Worldwide 6.16 5.96 5.63 In October 2008, the Corporation closed Brent crude oil hedges covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after-tax losses, as of the date the hedge positions were closed, were recorded in earnings as the contracts matured. The Corporation also entered into Brent crude oil hedges using fixed-price swap contracts to hedge 120,000 boepd of crude oil sales volumes for the full year of 2012 at an average price of $107.70 per barrel. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by $431 million ($688 million before income taxes) in 2012, $327 million ($517 million before income taxes) in 2011 and $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2010. Both of these hedge programs matured as of December 31, 2012. In January and February 2013, the Corporation entered into Brent crude oil hedges using fixed-price swap contracts to hedge 90,000 boepd of crude oil sales volumes for the remainder of the calendar year at an average price of approximately $109.70 per barrel. Production and Sales Volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 406,000 boepd in 2012, 370,000 boepd in 2011 and 418,000 boepd in 2010. Approximately 75% in 2012, 72% in 2011 and 73% in 2010 of the Corporation’s production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 375,000 boepd and 390,000 boepd in 2013. This forecast assumes Russian operations remain in the portfolio for the full year. 23 Table of Contents The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2012 2011 2010 (In thousands) Crude oil — barrels per day United States Bakken 47 26 12 Other Onshore 13 11 11 Total Onshore 60 37 23 Offshore 48 44 52 Total United States 108 81 75 Europe 84 89 88 Africa 75 66 113 Asia 17 13 13 Total 284 249 289 Natural gas liquids — barrels per day United States Bakken 5 2 2 Other Onshore 5 5 5 Total Onshore 10 7 7 Offshore 6 6 7 Total United States 16 13 14 Europe 2 3 3 Asia 1 1 1 Total 19 17 18 Natural gas — mcf per day United States Bakken 27 13 9 Other Onshore 27 26 29 Total Onshore 54 39 38 Offshore 65 61 70 Total United States 119 100 108 Europe 43 81 134 Asia and other 454 442 427 Total 616 623 669 Barrels of oil equivalent — per day* 406 370 418 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices table. United States: Crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production in the United States was higher in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to new wells in the Bakken oil shale play. In the second quarter of 2012, production restarted from a well at the Llano Field after a successful workover of the well, which had been shut-in for mechanical reasons since the first quarter of 2011. Crude oil production was higher in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to new wells in the Bakken oil shale play, partly offset by lower production due to the shut-in well at the Llano Field. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to this shut-in well at the Llano Field. Europe: Crude oil production in 2012 was lower than 2011, primarily due to downtime at the Valhall Field in Norway which was shut-in from mid-July 2012 until January 2013 in order to complete a field redevelopment project. Crude oil production in 2011 was comparable to 2010, as higher production from Norway and Russia was largely offset by lower production from the Corporation’s United Kingdom North Sea assets. Natural gas production was lower in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to the sale of the Snohvit Field, offshore Norway, in January 2012, downtime at the Valhall Field as noted above and natural decline at the Beryl Field in the United Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to the sale in February 2011 of certain natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. 24 Table of Contents Africa: Crude oil production increased in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly due to the resumption of production in Libya, partly offset by lower production in Equatorial Guinea due to downtime and natural field decline. Following the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed in response to civil unrest, the Corporation’s production in Libya resumed during the fourth quarter of 2011 after being shut-in from the first quarter of 2011. Crude oil production decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the suspension of production in Libya, the exchange in September 2010 of the Corporation’s interests in Gabon for increased interests in Norway, lower production entitlement in Equatorial Guinea and Algeria as a result of higher selling prices and natural decline in Equatorial Guinea. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2012 was higher than 2011, primarily due to new wells at the Pangkah Field in Indonesia and a full year’s contribution from the Gajah Baru Complex at the Natuna A Field in Indonesia, which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011. Natural gas production in 2011 was higher than 2010, primarily due to higher nominations at Block PM301 in Malaysia and first production from the Gajah Baru Complex. Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $1,225 million in 2012 compared with 2011, and lower sales volumes and other operating revenues decreased revenue by approximately $1,100 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Operating Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $401 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and increased by $460 million in 2011 compared with 2010. The increase in 2012 reflects higher production taxes as a result of increased production volumes at the Bakken oil shale play and in Russia, together with higher operating and maintenance costs at the Valhall Field in Norway, the Llano Field in the United States and the Bakken. The increase in costs in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices, together with higher operating and maintenance expenses, mainly in Norway and the Bakken. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $548 million in 2012 and $83 million in 2011, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to higher volumes and per barrel costs. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. In addition, the higher per barrel rates in 2012 and 2011 were largely due to greater production contribution from unconventional assets. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $20.63 in 2012, $19.71 in 2011 and $14.45 in 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $19.20 in 2012, $17.06 in 2011 and $14.56 in 2010. For 2013, cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of $21.00 to $22.00 per barrel and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of $19.00 to $20.00 per barrel, resulting in total unit costs of $40.00 to $42.00 per barrel of oil equivalent. Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses decreased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and lease amortization. Dry hole expenses in 2012 included amounts associated with two exploration wells, Ness Deep in the Gulf of Mexico and Ajek-1, offshore Indonesia. Exploration expenses increased in 2011 from 2010, mainly due to higher dry hole expenses, which included amounts relating to two exploration wells on the Semai V Block, offshore Indonesia, and a well in the North Red Sea Block 1, offshore Egypt. Income Taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 45% in 2012, 38% in 2011 and 44% in 2010. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2012 compared with 2011 was predominantly due to the resumption of Libyan operations. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2013 is estimated to be in the range of 46% to 50%. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Gains on asset sales $ 584 $ 446 $ 1,208 $ 557 $ 413 $ 1,130 Asset impairments (582 ) (358 ) (532 ) (344 ) (140 ) (334 ) Dry hole and other expenses (86 ) — (101 ) (56 ) — (64 ) Income tax adjustments — — — (201 ) (29 ) — $ (84 ) $ 88 $ 575 $ (44 ) $ 244 $ 732 25 Table of Contents 2012: The Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Schiehallion Field (Hess 16%), the Bittern Field (Hess 28%) and related assets, which are all located in the United Kingdom North Sea, and the Snohvit Field (Snohvit) (Hess 3%), offshore Norway, for total cash proceeds of $843 million. These transactions resulted in pre-tax gains totaling $584 million ($557 million after income taxes). These assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 15,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 83 million boe of proved reserves. See also Note 2, Dispositions in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2012, E&P recorded three asset impairment charges totaling $582 million ($344 million after income taxes). As a result of a competitive bidding process, the Corporation obtained additional information relating to the fair value of its interests in the Cotulla area of the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas in February 2013. Based on this information and management’s anticipated plan for the assets as of December 31, 2012, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $315 million ($192 million after income taxes). The Corporation also recorded charges of $208 million ($116 million after income taxes) related to increases in estimated abandonment liabilities primarily for non-producing properties which resulted in the book value of the properties exceeding their fair value. In addition, the Corporation recorded a charge of $59 million ($36 million after income taxes) in the second quarter related to the disposal of certain Eagle Ford properties as part of an asset exchange with its joint venture partner. During the third quarter of 2012, the Corporation decided to cease further development and appraisal activities in Peru. As a result, the Corporation recorded exploration expenses totaling $86 million ($56 million after income taxes) to write off its exploration assets in the country. In July 2012, the government of the United Kingdom changed the supplementary income tax rate applicable to deductions for dismantlement expenditures to 20% from 32%. As a result, the Corporation recorded a one-time charge in the third quarter of 2012 of $115 million for deferred taxes related to asset retirement obligations in the United Kingdom. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Corporation recorded an income tax charge of $86 million for a disputed application of an international tax treaty. 2011: The Corporation completed the sale of its interests in certain natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea, the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway, and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for total cash proceeds of $490 million. These disposals resulted in pre-tax gains totaling $446 million ($413 million after income taxes). These assets had an aggregate net productive capacity of approximately 17,500 boepd at the time of sale. In the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation recorded asset impairment charges of $358 million ($140 million after income taxes) related to increases in the Corporation’s estimated abandonment liabilities primarily for non-producing properties in the United Kingdom North Sea which resulted in the book value of the properties exceeding their fair value. In July 2011, the United Kingdom increased the supplementary tax rate on petroleum operations to 32% from 20% with an effective date of March 24, 2011. As a result, the Corporation recorded a charge of $29 million to increase deferred tax liabilities in the United Kingdom. 2010: The Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This non-monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia (Hess 25%) for cash proceeds of $183 million. The transaction resulted in a gain of $58 million. The Corporation recorded an asset impairment charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt when the Corporation and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. The West Med Block was relinquished in 2011. The Corporation also recorded $101 million ($64 million after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and Block BM-S-22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior to 2010. Marketing and Refining Results from M&R activities were earnings of $231 million in 2012, a loss of $584 million in 2011 and a loss of $231 million in 2010. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table below, M&R results were earnings of $160 million in 2012, a loss of $59 million in 2011 and earnings of $58 million in 2010. 26 Table of Contents M&R Sales and other operating revenue were $25,520 million, $27,936 million and $24,885 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2012, Sales and other operating revenue decreased compared with 2011, reflecting lower refined petroleum product sales volumes together with lower gas and electricity selling prices. In 2011, Sales and other operating revenues increased compared with 2010, primarily due to higher refined petroleum product selling prices partially offset by the effect of lower refined petroleum product sales volumes. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported M&R earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) LIFO inventory liquidation $ 165 $ — $ — $ 104 $ — $ — Asset impairments and other charges (43 ) — — (33 ) — — Charges related to equity investment in HOVENSA — (875 ) (300 ) — (525 ) (289 ) $ 122 $ (875 ) $ (300 ) $ 71 $ (525 ) $ (289 ) In 2012, the Corporation recorded income of $165 million ($104 million after income taxes) from the partial liquidation of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventories. The Corporation also recorded charges of $43 million ($33 million after income taxes) for asset impairments to certain marketing properties and other charges. As a result of continued substantial operating losses and unsuccessful efforts to improve operating performance by reducing refining capacity, HOVENSA prepared an impairment analysis as of December 31, 2011, which concluded that undiscounted future cash flows would not recover the carrying value of its long-lived assets, and recorded an impairment charge and other charges related to the decision to shut down the refinery. In 2011, the Corporation recorded a charge of $875 million ($525 million after income taxes) due to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges associated with its decision to shut down the refinery. The Corporation’s share of the impairment related losses recorded by HOVENSA represented an amount equivalent to the Corporation’s financial support to HOVENSA at December 31, 2011, its planned future funding commitments for costs related to the refinery shutdown, and a charge of $135 million for the write-off of related assets held by the subsidiary which owns the Corporation’s investment in HOVENSA. A deferred income tax benefit of $350 million, consisting primarily of U.S. income taxes, was recorded on the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s impairment and refinery shutdown related charges. In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA to fair value. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated earnings of $209 million in 2012, $185 million in 2011 and $215 million in 2010. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, Marketing earnings were $138 million in 2012, $185 million in 2011 and $215 million in 2010. The decrease in earnings over the period from 2010 to 2012 was primarily due to lower margins and lower refined product sales volumes. The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes: 2012 2011 2010 Refined petroleum product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 389 430 471 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,300 2,200 2,000 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,500 4,400 4,100 Refining: Refining results consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s losses, together with the results of Port Reading and other operating activities. Refining generated earnings of $28 million in 2012, a loss of $728 million in 2011 and a loss of $445 million in 2010. The Corporation did not record any incremental equity income or loss for HOVENSA in 2012, as the Corporation fully accrued its estimated funding commitments for HOVENSA’s refinery shutdown at December 31, 2011. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results was a loss of $198 million in 2011 and a loss of $137 million ($222 million before income taxes) in 2010, reflecting weak refining margins. U.S. Virgin Island income taxes were not recorded on the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s 2011 results due to cumulative operating losses. 27 Table of Contents Other after-tax refining results, principally from Port Reading operations, generated earnings of $28 million in 2012, a loss of $5 million in 2011 and a loss of $19 million in 2010. The Port Reading refining facility has a capacity of 70,000 barrels per day and the facility operated at a rate of 59,000 barrels per day in 2012, 63,000 barrels per day in 2011 and 55,000 barrels per day in 2010. In January 2013, the Corporation announced its decision to cease refining operations in February at its Port Reading facility. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to losses of $6 million in 2012, $41 million in 2011 and $1 million in 2010. Marketing expenses decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 principally reflecting lower retail credit card fees. Marketing expenses increased in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting higher retail credit card fees, maintenance, environmental and employee related expenses. The Corporation’s future M&R earnings may be impacted by supply and demand factors, volatility in margins, credit risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporation’s M&R business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 262 $ 260 $ 256 Income taxes (benefits) (104 ) (106 ) (104 ) Net corporate expenses, after-tax 158 154 152 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after-tax — — 7 Total corporate expenses, after-tax $ 158 $ 154 $ 159 Corporate expenses were comparable in 2012, 2011 and 2010. After-tax corporate expenses in 2013 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. Interest Expense The following table summarizes interest expense: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Total interest incurred $ 447 $ 396 $ 366 Less: Capitalized interest (28 ) (13 ) (5 ) Interest expense before income taxes 419 383 361 Income taxes (benefits) (159 ) (149 ) (140 ) Total interest expense, after-tax $ 260 $ 234 $ 221 The increase in interest expense incurred in 2012 and 2011 principally reflects higher average debt and bank facility fees. Capitalized interest increased in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to the sanctioning of the Tubular Bells project in September 2011. After-tax interest expense in 2013 is expected to be in the range of $255 million to $265 million. 28 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2012 2011 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 642 $ 351 Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt $ 787 $ 52 Total debt $ 8,111 $ 6,057 Total equity $ 21,203 $ 18,592 Debt to capitalization ratio* 27.7 % 24.6 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 5,660 $ 4,984 $ 4,530 Investing activities (7,051 ) (6,566 ) (5,259 ) Financing activities 1,682 325 975 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 291 $ (1,257 ) $ 246 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $5,660 million in 2012 compared with $4,984 million in 2011, reflecting higher operating earnings and increases in cash flows from changes in working capital. Operating cash flow increased to $4,984 million in 2011 from $4,530 million in 2010 principally reflecting higher operating earnings partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from changes in working capital. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2012 2011 2010 (In millions) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 619 $ 869 $ 552 Production and development 6,790 4,673 2,592 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 267 1,346 2,250 7,676 6,888 5,394 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 119 118 98 Total $ 7,795 $ 7,006 $ 5,492 The increased spend on capital expenditures in 2012 primarily reflected additional spending at the Bakken oil shale play as a result of drilling new wells, higher working interest wells and increased spending on field infrastructure projects. Capital expenditures in 2011 included acquisitions of approximately $800 million for 195,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in Ohio, $214 million for interests in two blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and $116 million for an additional 4% interest in the South Arne Field in Denmark. Capital expenditures in 2010 included acquisitions of 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. The Corporation received total proceeds from the sale of assets in the E&P segment of $843 million in 2012, $490 million in 2011 and $183 million in 2010. Financing Activities: During 2012, the Corporation borrowed a net of $1,845 million from available credit facilities, which consisted of borrowings of $758 million from its syndicated revolving credit facility, $890 million from its short-term credit facilities and $250 million from its asset-backed credit facility, partially offset 29 Table of Contents by net repayments of other debt of $53 million. During 2011, net proceeds from borrowings on available credit facilities were $422 million. During 2010, net proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million, including the August 2010 issuance of $1,250 million of 30-year fixed-rate public notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to mature in 2041. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of fixed-rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. Total common stock dividends paid were $171 million in 2012, $136 million in 2011 and $131 million in 2010. In 2012, the Corporation made five quarterly common stock dividend payments as a result of accelerating payment of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend, which historically would have been paid in the first quarter of 2013. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $11 million, $88 million and $54 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2013, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. This reflects an 18 percent reduction from the 2012 total of $8.3 billion. The decrease is substantially attributable to a reduced level of spend in the Bakken driven by lower drilling and completion costs and decreased investments in infrastructure projects. During 2012, the Corporation funded its capital spending through cash flows from operations, incremental borrowings and proceeds from asset sales. The Corporation had a cash flow deficit of approximately $2.5 billion in 2012 and the projected deficit for 2013 is expected to moderate versus 2012 based on current commodity prices. During 2012, the Corporation announced asset sales totaling $2.4 billion, of which cash proceeds of $843 million were received in 2012 and approximately $440 million were received in January 2013. The Corporation is also pursuing the sale of its Russian operations, Eagle Ford assets and its terminal network. The Corporation expects to fund its 2013 capital expenditures and ongoing operations, including dividends, pension contributions and debt repayments with existing cash on-hand, cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and/or further asset sales. See Overview on page 20 for a discussion of Elliott Management Corporation. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2012: ExpirationDate Capacity Borrowings Letters ofCredit Issued Total Used AvailableCapacity (In millions) Revolving credit facility April 2016 $ 4,000 $ 758 $ — $ 758 $ 3,242 Asset-backed credit facility July 2013 (a) 642 600 — 600 42 Committed lines Various (b) 2,730 500 463 963 1,767 Uncommitted lines Various (b) 773 490 283 773 — Total $ 8,145 $ 2,348 $ 746 $ 3,094 $ 5,051 (a) Total capacity of $1 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (b) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2014. The Corporation has a $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in April 2016. This facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility bear interest at 1.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A fee of 0.25% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The Corporation has a 364-day asset-backed credit facility secured by certain accounts receivable from its M&R operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2012, outstanding borrowings under this facility of $600 million were collateralized by a total of 30 Table of Contents approximately $1,050 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset-backed facility. On February 27, 2012, the Corporation filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain a financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. At December 31, 2012, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $27.2 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.9 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2012. The Corporation’s $746 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2012 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 20, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2012: Total Payments Due by Period 2013 2014 and2015 2016 and2017 Thereafter (In millions) Total debt* $ 8,111 $ 787 $ 530 $ 1,617 $ 5,177 Operating leases 2,843 700 831 252 1,060 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 5,702 4,664 723 122 193 Capital expenditures and other investments 3,117 1,558 1,015 407 137 Operating expenses 2,582 1,387 558 314 323 Other liabilities 3,972 529 749 392 2,302 * At December 31, 2012, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 5.3%. Supply commitments include term purchase agreements at market prices for a portion of the gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year-end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporation’s planned $6.8 billion capital investment program for 2013 that was contractually committed at December 31, 2012. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture. This contingent obligation, which expires in April 2014, was approximately $210 million at December 31, 2012. 31 Table of Contents The Corporation is contingently liable under $141 million of letters of credit of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2012. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $342 million at December 31, 2012 compared with $388 million at December 31, 2011. If these leases were included as debt, the Corporation’s December 31, 2012 debt to capitalization ratio would increase to 28.5% from 27.7%. See also Note 17, Guarantees and Contingencies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brunei, China, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, acts of terrorism, tax law changes and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior 32 Table of Contents management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves. Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below, there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market-based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation has concluded that the E&P segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, since the E&P segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level. Accordingly, the Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment. If any of the E&P segment components, such as our financial reporting regions (United States, Europe, Africa and Asia) were considered to be reporting units, an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill (ASC 350-20-35). If components are economically similar, that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. While the Corporation believes that the E&P segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed, it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting (ASC 280-10-50-11) and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons: • The Corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single, global business. • Each component produces oil and gas. • The exploration and production processes are similar in each component. • The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar. • Customers of each component are similar. • The components share technical resources and support services. If the Corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit, goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the E&P segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential 33 Table of Contents synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar E&P companies. The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the E&P segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the E&P segment. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future 34 Table of Contents returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporation’s financial statements. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy-related commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporation’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. To value derivatives that are characterized as Level 2 and 3, the Corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges, pricing services or broker quotes. These observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods, including internal extrapolation or interpolation, that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. 35 Table of Contents Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation’s long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in the Corporation’s environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. Over the last several years, many refineries have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with the New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. In April 2012, the Corporation entered into a consent decree with the EPA to resolve these matters as they relate to its Port Reading refinery facility. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, Hess paid a penalty of $850,000 and agreed to implement a program to reduce emissions at the refinery. The emissions reduction program in the Consent Decree is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Corporation. In January 2013, the Corporation announced its decision to cease refining operations in February at its Port Reading facility. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation assesses, monitors and takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. The Corporation is committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions mandates and the responsible management of GHG emissions at its facilities. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. 36 Table of Contents The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2012, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $55 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was $19 million in 2012, $19 million in 2011 and $13 million in 2010. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were approximately $70 million in 2012, $95 million in 2011 and $85 million in 2010. Forward-looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Business and Properties, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, asset sales, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward-looking information. These sections typically include statements with words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “guidance”, “could”, “may”, “should”, “would” or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporation’s results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership, that trades energy-related commodities, securities and derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent price verifications (IPV’s) of sources of fair values, validations of valuation models and analyzes changes in fair value measurements on a daily, monthly and/or quarterly basis. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. 37 Table of Contents • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. • Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy-related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined petroleum products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed-rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies, including the British Pound and the Thai Baht. At December 31, 2012, the Corporation had a receivable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2013 with a fair value of $14 million. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $125 million at December 31, 2012. The Corporation’s outstanding long-term debt of $7,361 million, including current maturities, has a fair value of $8,887 million at December 31, 2012. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $200 million at December 31, 2012. Following is the value at risk for the Corporation’s energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities, excluding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives described above: 2012 2011 (In millions) At December 31 $ 7 $ 94 Average 49 30 High 95 94 Low 7 8 The decrease in the value at risk for the Corporation’s energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities in 2012 primarily reflects the maturing of Brent crude oil cash flow hedge positions as described in Note 20, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 38 Table of Contents Trading Activities Trading activities are conducted principally through a trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest. This consolidated entity intends to generate earnings through various strategies primarily using energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer February 28, 2013 41 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries, and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /S/ ERNST & YOUNG, LLP February 28, 2013 New York, New York 42 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012.

(e) Includes after-tax expenses totaling $104 million relating to repurchases of fixed-rate public notes, retirement benefits, employee severance costs and asset impairments, partially offset by after-tax income totaling $101 million principally relating to the resolution of a U.S. royalty dispute. 20 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Hess Corporation (the Corporation or Hess) is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company that develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. Prior to 2013, the Corporation also operated a Marketing and Refining (M&R) segment, which it began to divest during the year. The M&R businesses manufacture refined petroleum products and purchase, market, store and trade refined products, natural gas and electricity, as well as operate retail gas stations, most of which have convenience stores. In the first quarter of 2013, the Corporation announced several initiatives to continue its transformation into a more focused pure play E&P company that is expected to deliver compound average production growth of 5% to 8% through 2017, from its 2012 pro forma production of 289,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). The transformation plan included fully exiting the Corporation’s M&R businesses, including its terminal, retail, energy marketing and energy trading operations, as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its Port Reading facility, thus completing its exit from all refining operations. HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50/50 joint venture between the Corporation’s subsidiary, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), had previously shut down its United States (U.S.) Virgin Islands refinery in January 2012 and continued operating solely as an oil storage terminal. HOVIC and its partner have also commenced a sales process for HOVENSA. The transformation plan also committed to the sale of mature E&P assets in Indonesia and Thailand and the pursuit of monetizing Bakken midstream assets by 2015. As part of its transformation during 2012 and 2013, the Corporation sold mature or lower margin assets in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Norway, Russia, the United Kingdom (UK) North Sea, and certain interests onshore in the U.S. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Corporation sold its energy marketing business and its terminal network. In 2014, the Corporation plans to divest its remaining downstream businesses, including its retail marketing business and energy trading joint venture, plus its E&P assets in Thailand. The Corporation has also reached an agreement to sell dry gas acreage in the Utica shale play in the U.S. Other actions announced by the Corporation in March 2013 included repaying debt, establishing a cash cushion and returning capital to shareholders. By year-end 2013, approximately $2.4 billion of short-term debt had been repaid. In addition, commencing in the third quarter of 2013, the Corporation increased its quarterly dividend 150% to $0.25 per common share and commenced share repurchases under its authorized $4 billion share repurchase program. Through December 31, 2013, Hess had purchased approximately 19.3 million common shares at a cost of approximately $1.54 billion. Net income was $5,052 million in 2013 compared with $2,025 million in 2012 and $1,703 million in 2011. Diluted earnings per share were $14.82 in 2013 compared with $5.95 in 2012 and $5.01 in 2011. Excluding items affecting comparability, net income was $1,892 million in 2013, $1,998 million in 2012, and $1,984 million in 2011. See the table of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 24. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,437 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2013 compared with 1,553 million boe at December 31, 2012 and 1,573 million boe at December 31, 2011. Proved reserves related to assets sold in 2013 totaled 139 million boe. Pro forma year-end reserves, which exclude assets in Indonesia and Thailand classified as held for sale at December 31, 2013, were 1,362 million boe. E&P earnings were $4,303 million in 2013, $2,212 million in 2012 and $2,675 million in 2011. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 28, E&P net income was $2,192 million, $2,256 million and $2,431 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Average realized crude oil selling prices including the impact of hedging were $98.48 per barrel in 2013, $86.94 in 2012 and $89.99 in 2011. Average realized natural gas selling prices were $6.64 per mcf in 2013, $6.16 in 2012 and $5.96 in 2011. Production averaged 336,000 boepd in 2013, 406,000 boepd in 2012 and 370,000 boepd in 2011. Excluding production from assets sold and classified as held for sale, pro forma production was 285,000 boepd in 2013 and 289,000 boepd in 2012. The Corporation expects compound average annual production growth of 5% to 8% through 2017, from 2012 pro forma production. The Corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 305,000 boepd and 315,000 boepd in 2014, excluding asset sales and any contribution from Libya, which has a net 21 Table of Contents production capacity of approximately 25,000 boepd and is shut-in due to civil unrest in the country. Pro forma production excluding Libya was 270,000 boepd in 2013 and 268,000 boepd in 2012. The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2013: • In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged 67,000 boepd during 2013, an increase of 20% from 56,000 boepd in 2012 despite the transition to pad drilling in the first half of the year and the required shut-ins late in the fourth quarter of 2013 for the expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2014. Production is expected to average between 80,000 boepd and 90,000 boepd in 2014, an increase of 19% to 34% from 2013. The Corporation also increased its peak net production guidance for the Bakken to 150,000 boepd in 2018 from prior guidance of 120,000 boepd in 2016, based upon performance to date and current development spacing based on five Middle Bakken wells and four Three Forks wells per 1,280 acre Drilling Spacing Unit (DSU). During 2014, the Corporation plans to pilot test tighter well spacing to determine whether there is additional upside in the estimates for future production and resources. During the year, 168 wells were brought on production bringing the total operated production wells to 722 . In 2014, the Corporation plans to increase the rig count in the Bakken to 17 from 14 but expects to maintain capital spending at approximately $2.2 billion, which is consistent with 2013 levels. • At the Valhall Field in Norway (Hess 64%), net production averaged 23,000 boepd during 2013, compared with 13,000 boepd during 2012. The Field was shut-in during the second half of 2012 and January 2013 to complete a multiyear redevelopment project. Full year 2014 net production for Valhall is expected to be in the range of 30,000 boepd to 35,000 boepd. • In the North Malay Basin, the project achieved first production from the Early Production System in October 2013 and net production averaged approximately 30 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. The Corporation expects net production to average approximately 40 million cubic feet per day through 2016 until full field development is completed in late 2016. Net production is expected to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017. • In December 2013, the Corporation commenced production from its phase three development program at the South Arne Field (Hess 62%) offshore Denmark, following the installation of two new wellhead platforms and modifications to existing production facilities. Development drilling will continue in 2014. • At Block A-18 of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), the Corporation successfully installed two new wellhead platforms and progressed a major booster compression project that is expected to be completed in 2015. • In the Utica shale, 29 wells were drilled, 24 wells were completed and 17 wells were tested across both the Corporation’s 100% owned and joint venture acreage. Production test rates in the wet gas area averaged over 2,200 boepd with 47% liquids. • In Libya, production from the Waha fields was shut-in late August of 2013 and remains shut-in due to civil unrest in the country. For the full year 2013, Libya production averaged 15,000 boepd. In addition, the Corporation wrote-off in the fourth quarter two previously capitalized exploration wells in offshore Area 54 which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $260 million ($163 million after income taxes). • During the year, the Corporation completed drilling its second and third production wells at the Tubular Bells Field, offshore U.S., and commenced a batch completion program during the fourth quarter of 2013 for the three wells drilled to date. Facilities construction is ongoing with offshore installation expected to commence in the first quarter and first oil in the third quarter of 2014 at a net rate of 25,000 boepd. • The Corporation completed its exploration drilling phase on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block, offshore Ghana that resulted in a total of seven successful exploration wells. The Corporation submitted appraisal plans to the Ghanaian government and four appraisal areas have been approved to date. A three well appraisal drilling program has been scheduled in the second half of 2014. • In the third quarter, the Corporation spud its first exploration well on the Shakrok block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (Hess 80%) and plans to begin drilling an exploration well on the Dinarta block in the first half of 2014. • During 2013, the E&P segment sold its assets in Azerbaijan and Russia as well as its interests in the Natuna A Field, offshore Indonesia, the Beryl fields in the UK North Sea and certain interests onshore in the U.S., for total proceeds of approximately $4.5 billion. Asset sales reduced production by approximately 60,000 boepd in 2013 compared to 2012. In January 2014, the Corporation announced it had reached agreement to sell approximately 74,000 acres of its 100% interest in the Utica Shale for $924 million. Approximately two-thirds of these proceeds are expected at the end of the first quarter of 2014, with the balance to be received in the third quarter of 2014. 22 Table of Contents Downstream Businesses The downstream businesses reported income of $1,189 million in 2013 and $231 million in 2012 and a loss of $584 million in 2011. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 31, the downstream businesses generated income of $116 million in 2013 and $160 million in 2012 and a loss of $59 million in 2011. The downstream businesses comprise the Corporation’s retail, energy marketing, terminal, energy trading and refining operations, together with its interests in two power plant joint ventures. By year-end all of these businesses were either divested by the Corporation or the divestiture processes remained on-going. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,870 million in 2013, $5,660 million in 2012 and $4,984 million in 2011. At December 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,814 million, up from $642 million at December 31, 2012. Total debt was $5,798 million at December 31, 2013 and $8,111 million at December 31, 2012. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2013 was 19.0% compared with 27.7% at the end of 2012. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Exploration and Production United States Bakken $ 2,231 $ 3,164 $ 2,361 Other Onshore 708 729 1,532 Total Onshore 2,939 3,893 3,893 Offshore 865 870 412 Total United States 3,804 4,763 4,305 Europe 724 1,381 1,274 Africa 630 771 414 Asia and other 993 1,231 1,351 Total Exploration and Production 6,151 8,146 7,344 Other* 164 119 118 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 6,315 $ 8,265 $ 7,462 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 192 $ 142 $ 197 International 250 328 259 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 442 $ 470 $ 456 * Includes capital expenditures related to discontinued operations of $33 million, $52 million and $65 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Corporation anticipates investing approximately $5.8 billion in E&P capital and exploratory expenditures in 2014 and approximately $350 million for retail marketing, primarily for the acquisition of its partner’s share of the WilcoHess joint venture which closed in January 2014. Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions, except per share amounts) Exploration and Production $ 4,303 $ 2,212 $ 2,675 Corporate and Interest (440 ) (418 ) (388 ) Downstream businesses 1,189 231 (584 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 5,052 $ 2,025 $ 1,703 Net income per share (diluted) $ 14.82 $ 5.95 $ 5.01 23 Table of Contents The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 28 through 31. 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Exploration and Production $ 2,111 $ (44 ) $ 244 Corporate and Interest (24 ) — — Downstream businesses 1,073 71 (525 ) Total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods $ 3,160 $ 27 $ (281 ) In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s E&P operations: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Sales and other operating revenues $ 11,905 $ 12,245 $ 10,646 Gains on asset sales, net 2,171 584 446 Other, net (57 ) 99 18 Total revenues and non-operating income 14,019 12,928 11,110 Costs and expenses Cost of products sold (excluding items shown separately below) 1,853 1,334 580 Operating costs and expenses 2,116 2,202 1,876 Production and severance taxes 372 550 476 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 1,031 1,070 1,195 General and administrative expenses 377 314 313 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,671 2,853 2,305 Asset impairments 289 582 358 Total costs and expenses 8,709 8,905 7,103 Results of operations before income taxes 5,310 4,023 4,007 Provision for income taxes 831 1,793 1,313 Net income 4,479 2,230 2,694 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 176 18 19 Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 4,303 $ 2,212 $ 2,675 Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 28, the changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, cost of products sold, cash operating costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling Prices: Average crude oil realized selling prices were 13% higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a combination of hedging losses realized in 2012, the second quarter 2013 sale of the Corporation’s subsidiary in Russia which had significantly lower crude oil prices, and slightly higher average West Texas Intermediary (WTI) benchmark prices in 2013. Average crude oil realized selling prices were 3% lower in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to lower average WTI benchmark prices. 24 Table of Contents The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Crude oil — per barrel (including hedging) United States Onshore $ 90.00 $ 84.78 $ 91.11 Offshore 103.83 101.80 104.83 Total United States 95.50 92.32 98.56 Europe 88.03 74.14 80.18 Africa 108.70 89.02 88.46 Asia 107.40 107.45 111.71 Worldwide 98.48 86.94 89.99 Crude oil — per barrel (excluding hedging) United States Onshore $ 89.81 $ 85.66 $ 91.11 Offshore 103.15 104.39 104.83 Total United States 95.11 93.96 98.56 Europe 87.45 75.06 80.18 Africa 108.07 110.92 110.28 Asia 107.40 109.35 111.71 Worldwide 98.01 93.70 95.60 Natural gas liquids — per barrel United States Onshore $ 43.14 $ 44.22 $ 79.75 Offshore 29.18 35.24 50.88 Total United States 38.07 40.75 58.59 Europe 58.31 78.43 75.49 Asia 74.94 77.92 72.29 Worldwide 40.68 47.81 62.72 Natural gas — per mcf United States Onshore $ 3.08 $ 2.02 $ 3.16 Offshore 2.83 2.15 3.54 Total United States 2.96 2.09 3.39 Europe 11.06 9.50 8.79 Asia and other 7.50 6.90 6.02 Worldwide 6.64 6.16 5.96 Crude oil price hedging contracts increased E&P Sales and other operating revenues by $39 million ($25 million after income taxes) in 2013, and reduced E&P Sales and other operating revenues by $688 million ($431 million after income taxes) in 2012 and $517 million ($327 million after income taxes) in 2011. During 2013, the Corporation had Brent crude oil fixed-price swap contracts to hedge 90,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) of crude oil sales volumes at an average price of $109.70 per barrel. In 2012, the Corporation had Brent crude oil fixed-price swap contracts to hedge 120,000 bopd of crude oil sales volumes for the full year at an average price of $107.70 per barrel. In 2011 and 2012, the Corporation also realized hedge losses from previously closed Brent crude oil hedges that covered 24,000 bopd during the year. The Corporation has entered into Brent crude oil fixed-price swap contracts to hedge 25,000 bopd for calendar year 2014 at an average price of $109.12 per barrel. Production Volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production was 336,000 boepd in 2013, 406,000 boepd in 2012 and 370,000 boepd in 2011. Approximately 72% in 2013, 75% in 2012 and 72% in 2011 of the Corporation’s 25 Table of Contents production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 305,000 boepd and 315,000 boepd in 2014, excluding asset sales and any contribution from Libya, which has a net production capacity of approximately 25,000 boepd and is shut-in due to civil unrest in the country. The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2013 2012 2011 (In thousands) Crude oil — barrels per day United States Bakken 55 47 26 Other Onshore 10 13 11 Total Onshore 65 60 37 Offshore 43 48 44 Total United States 108 108 81 Europe 44 84 89 Africa 62 75 66 Asia 11 17 13 Total 225 284 249 Natural gas liquids — barrels per day United States Bakken 6 5 2 Other Onshore 4 5 5 Total Onshore 10 10 7 Offshore 5 6 6 Total United States 15 16 13 Europe 1 2 3 Asia 1 1 1 Total 17 19 17 Natural gas — mcf per day United States Bakken 38 27 13 Other Onshore 25 27 26 Total Onshore 63 54 39 Offshore 61 65 61 Total United States 124 119 100 Europe 23 43 81 Asia and other 418 454 442 Total 565 616 623 Barrels of oil equivalent — per day* 336 406 370 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. In addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices on page 25. United States: Crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was comparable in 2013 and 2012, as higher production from the Bakken oil shale play was partly offset by natural decline and maintenance in the other U.S. assets. Crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to new wells in the Bakken oil shale play. In the second quarter of 2012, production restarted following the successful workover of a well in the Llano Field, which had been shut-in for mechanical reasons since the first quarter of 2011. Europe: Crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to asset sales. The Bittern and Schiehallion fields in the UK North Sea, which were sold in the second half of 2012, were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 12,000 boepd at the time of sale. The Beryl fields, also in the UK North Sea, which were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 10,000 boepd at the time of sale, were sold in the first quarter of 2013, and the Corporation’s Russian subsidiary, which was producing approximately 50,000 boepd at the time of sale, was sold in April 2013. Crude oil production in 2012 was lower than 2011, primarily due to the downtime at the Valhall Field in 26 Table of Contents Norway, during the second half of 2012. Natural gas production was lower in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to the sale of the Snohvit Field, offshore Norway, in January 2012, downtime at the Valhall Field and natural decline at the Beryl fields in the UK North Sea. Africa: Crude oil production in Africa was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to the shutdown of the Es Sider terminal in Libya in the third quarter of 2013, following civil unrest in the country. In addition, offshore Equatorial Guinea production was lower due to decline at the Okume Complex, partially offset by new production from the Ceiba Field. Crude oil production increased in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly due to the resumption of production in Libya, partly offset by lower production in Equatorial Guinea due to downtime and natural field decline. Asia and Other: Crude oil production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, mainly due to the sale in March 2013 of the Corporation’s interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields in Azerbaijan. The assets were producing at a net rate of approximately 6,000 boepd at the time of sale. Natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, mainly due to lower production entitlement at the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA) together with lower production at the Pangkah Field in Indonesia following the facility’s shutdown for planned maintenance in the second quarter of 2013. Natural gas production in 2012 was higher than 2011, primarily due to new wells at the Pangkah Field in Indonesia and a full year’s contribution from the Gajah Baru Complex at the Natuna A Field in Indonesia, which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011. Sales Volumes: The Corporation’s worldwide sales volumes were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 (In thousands) Crude oil — barrels 82,402 101,770 92,235 Natural gas liquids — barrels 6,244 7,138 6,346 Natural gas — mcf 206,122 225,607 227,331 Barrels of oil equivalent* 123,000 146,510 136,470 Crude oil — barrels per day 226 278 253 Natural gas liquids — barrels per day 17 19 17 Natural gas — mcf per day 565 616 623 Barrels of oil equivalent per day* 337 400 374 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. In addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices on page 25. Cost of Products Sold: Cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from the Corporation’s partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties. The increase in Cost of products sold in the 2013 compared with 2012 and 2011 principally reflected higher volumes of crude oil purchases from third parties. Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of Operating costs and expenses, Production and severance taxes and General and administrative expenses, decreased by $201 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and increased by $401 million in 2012 compared with 2011. The decrease in 2013 was due to lower production taxes mainly due to the sale of the Corporation’s Russian operations, lower transportation costs, lower lease operating expenses and employee costs, partly offset by severance charges and other exit costs incurred as part of the Corporation’s transformation to a pure play E&P company. The increase in costs in 2012 reflects higher production taxes as a result of increased production volumes at the Bakken oil shale play and in Russia, together with higher operating and maintenance costs at the Valhall Field in Norway, the Llano Field, offshore U.S. in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken, onshore in the U.S. 27 Table of Contents Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges decreased by $182 million in 2013 and increased by $548 million in 2012, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The decrease in 2013 primarily reflects asset sales and the mix of production volumes. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to higher volumes and per barrel costs associated with the assets that contributed the production growth. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table below, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $22.63 in 2013, $20.63 in 2012 and $19.71 in 2011 and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $21.61 in 2013, $19.20 in 2012 and $17.06 in 2011. Total production unit costs were $44.24 per boe in 2013, $39.83 per boe in 2012 and $36.77 per boe in 2011. Excluding assets sold, classified as held for sale, and any contribution from Libyan operations, pro forma total production unit costs for 2013 were $49.80 per boe. For 2014, cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of $29.00 to $30.00 per barrel, resulting in total production unit costs of $49.50 to $51.50 per barrel of oil equivalent assuming no contribution from Libya. Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and geological and seismic expenses partly offset by higher leasehold amortization expenses. Dry hole expenses in 2013 included an amount to write-off previously capitalized wells in Area 54, offshore Libya. Leasehold amortization expenses in 2013 included a charge to write-off the Corporation’s leasehold acreage in the Marcellus, onshore U.S. Exploration expenses decreased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and lease amortization. Dry hole expenses in 2012 included amounts associated with two exploration wells, Ness Deep in the Gulf of Mexico and Ajek-1, offshore Indonesia. Income Taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 43% in 2013, 45% in 2012 and 38% in 2011. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of shut-in production in Libya from the third quarter of 2013. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2012 compared with 2011 was predominantly due to the resumption of Libyan operations, which were shut-in for substantially all of 2011. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2014, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, is estimated to be in the range of 37% to 41% assuming no contribution from Libya. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Gains on asset sales, net $ 2,195 $ 584 $ 446 $ 2,145 $ 557 $ 413 Noncontrolling interest share of gain on asset sale (168 ) — — (168 ) — — Asset impairments (289 ) (582 ) (358 ) (187 ) (344 ) (140 ) Dry hole and other expenses (260 ) (86 ) — (163 ) (56 ) — Leasehold amortization (38 ) — — (23 ) — — Employee severance* (67 ) — — (55 ) — — Facility and other exit costs (62 ) — — (62 ) — — Income tax adjustments — — — 624 (201 ) (29 ) $ 1,311 $ (84 ) $ 88 $ 2,111 $ (44 ) $ 244 * Amounts are net of the reversal of share-based compensation expense of $8 million ($7 million after income taxes) for expected stock grant forfeitures. 2013: In the fourth quarter, the Corporation announced the sale of its Indonesian assets for after-tax proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The sale was executed in two separate transactions with the sale of Natuna A completing in December 2013 and the sale of Pangkah closing in January 2014, as a result of a partner exercising their preemptive rights. The sale of Natuna A, which had sales proceeds of approximately $656 million, resulted in a pre-tax gain of $388 million ($343 million after income taxes). The Natuna Field was producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 5,500 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 21 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2012. The Corporation recorded a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $289 million ($187 million after income taxes) related to Pangkah to adjust its carrying value to its fair value at December 31, 2013. In April, the Corporation completed the sale of its Russian subsidiary, Samara-Nafta, for cash proceeds of $2.1 billion after working capital and other adjustments. Based on the Corporation’s 90% interest in Samara-Nafta, after-tax proceeds to Hess were approximately $1.9 billion. This transaction resulted in a nontaxable gain on 28 Table of Contents sale of $1,119 million, of which $168 million related to the noncontrolling interest holder’s share, resulting in a net gain attributable to the Corporation of $951 million. Samara-Nafta was producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 50,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 82 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2012. In the first quarter of 2013, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Beryl fields in the UK North Sea for cash proceeds of $442 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $328 million ($323 million after income taxes) and the sale of its interests in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields, offshore Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea, for cash proceeds of $884 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $360 million ($360 million after income taxes). These assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 16,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 38 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2012. See also Note 2, Dispositions in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2013, the Corporation recorded dry hole costs of $260 million ($163 million after income taxes) associated with Area 54, offshore Libya due to continued civil unrest in the country.

See also Note 4, Exit and Disposal Costs in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2013, Denmark enacted a new hydrocarbon income tax law that resulted in a combination of changes to tax rates, revisions to the amount of uplift allowed on capital expenditures and special transition rules. As a consequence of the tax law change, the Corporation recorded a deferred tax asset of $674 million. In addition, during 2013, the Corporation recorded a non-cash income tax charge of $28 million as a result of a planned asset divestiture and a charge of $22 million relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings. 2012: The Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Schiehallion Field (Hess 16%) and the Bittern Field (Hess 28%), which are both located in the UK North Sea, as well as the Snohvit Field (Hess 3%), offshore Norway, for total cash proceeds of $843 million. These transactions resulted in pre-tax gains totaling $584 million ($557 million after income taxes). These assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 15,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 83 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2011. See also Note 2, Dispositions in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation recorded asset impairment charges totaling $582 million ($344 million after income taxes). These impairment charges consisted of $374 million ($228 million after income taxes) associated with the divestiture of assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and $208 million ($116 million after income taxes) related to non-producing properties in the UK North Sea. During 2012, the Corporation decided to cease further development and appraisal activities in Peru. As a result, the Corporation recorded exploration expenses totaling $86 million ($56 million after income taxes) to write-off its exploration assets in the country. In July 2012, the government of the UK changed the supplementary income tax rate applicable to deductions for dismantlement expenditures to 20% from 32%. As a result, the Corporation recorded a one-time charge in the third quarter of 2012 of $115 million for deferred taxes related to asset retirement obligations in the UK. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Corporation recorded an income tax charge of $86 million for a disputed application of an international tax treaty. 2011: The Corporation completed the sale of its interests in certain natural gas producing assets in the UK North Sea, the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway, and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the UK North Sea for total cash proceeds of $490 million. These disposals resulted in pre-tax gains totaling $446 million ($413 million after income taxes). These assets had an aggregate net productive capacity of approximately 17,500 boepd at the time of sale. In the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation recorded asset impairment charges of $358 million ($140 million after income taxes) related to increases in the Corporation’s estimated abandonment liabilities for non-producing properties. In July 2011, the UK increased the supplementary tax rate on petroleum operations to 32% from 20%. As a result, the Corporation recorded a charge of $29 million to increase deferred tax liabilities in the UK. 29 Table of Contents Corporate and Interest The following table summarizes corporate and interest expenses: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 263 $ 262 $ 260 Interest expense 466 447 396 Less: Capitalized interest (60 ) (28 ) (13 ) Interest expense, net 406 419 383 Corporate and Interest expenses before income taxes 669 681 643 Income taxes (benefits) (253 ) (263 ) (255 ) Net Corporate and Interest expenses after income taxes 416 418 388 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after-tax 24 — — Total Corporate and Interest expenses after income taxes $ 440 $ 418 $ 388 Corporate expenses were comparable in 2013, 2012 and 2011. After-tax corporate expenses in 2014 are estimated to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, down from adjusted expenses excluding items affecting comparability provided below of $161 million in 2013. The decrease in 2013 interest expense, net primarily reflects higher capitalized interest related to the Tubular Bells and North Malay Basin projects. The increase in 2012 interest expense, net principally reflects higher average debt and bank facility fees, partially offset by higher capitalized interest due to the sanctioning of the Tubular Bells project in September 2011. After-tax interest expense in 2014 is expected to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, down from $255 million in 2013. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported Corporate and Interest expenses included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Employee severance* $ (21 ) $ — $ — $ (13 ) $ — $ — Facility and other exit costs (17 ) — — (11 ) — — $ (38 ) $ — $ — $ (24 ) $ — $ — * Amounts are net of the reversal of share-based compensation expense of $8 million ($5 million after income taxes) for expected stock grant forfeitures.

In addition, the Corporation incurred a pre-tax charge of $17 million ($11 million after income taxes) associated with the cessation of certain leased office space in 2013. Downstream Businesses Downstream businesses reported income of $1,189 million in 2013, income of $231 million in 2012 and a loss of $584 million in 2011. The downstream businesses comprise the Corporation’s retail, energy marketing, terminal, energy trading and refining operations. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below, the downstream businesses generated earnings of $116 million in 2013, earnings of $160 million in 2012 and a loss of $59 million in 2011. These results reflect earnings from marketing operations and Port Reading refining activities which were permanently shut down in February 2013. In 2011, the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results was a loss of $198 million. 30 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported earnings for the downstream businesses included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Gains on asset sales, net $ 1,500 $ — $ — $ 995 $ — $ — LIFO inventory liquidations 678 165 — 414 104 — Facility and other exit costs (59 ) — — (36 ) — — Employee severance* (131 ) — — (80 ) — — Asset impairments (80 ) (43 ) — (51 ) (33 ) — Port Reading refinery shutdown costs (82 ) — — (49 ) — — Other charges (173 ) — — (106 ) — — Income tax adjustments — — — (14 ) — — Charges related to equity investment in HOVENSA — — (875 ) — — (525 ) $ 1,653 $ 122 $ (875 ) $ 1,073 $ 71 $ (525 ) * Amounts are net of the reversal of share-based compensation expense of $17 million ($10 million after income taxes) for expected stock grant forfeitures. 2013: In December 2013, the Corporation sold its U.S. East Coast terminal network, St. Lucia terminal and related businesses for cash proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $739 million ($531 million after income taxes). In November 2013, the Corporation sold its energy marketing business for cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $761 million ($464 million after income taxes). In addition, the Corporation recognized pre-tax gains of $678 million ($414 million after income taxes) relating to the liquidation of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventories as a result of ceasing refining operations and the sales of its energy marketing and terminals businesses. During the year, the Corporation incurred $131 million ($80 million after income taxes) of net employee severance charges and $59 million ($36 million after income taxes) of other exit costs, including legal and professional fees. The Corporation also incurred charges of $173 million ($106 million after taxes) for legal, environmental, non-cash mark-to-market adjustments in energy marketing and other charges and $14 million for an income tax adjustment. As a result of the permanent shutdown of the Port Reading refining facility, the Corporation recorded charges of $82 million ($49 million after income taxes) for shutdown related costs and $80 million ($51 million after income taxes) for asset impairments. 2012: In 2012, the Corporation recorded pre-tax income of $165 million ($104 million after income taxes) from the partial liquidation of LIFO inventories. The Corporation also recorded pre-tax charges of $43 million ($33 million after income taxes) for asset impairments to certain marketing properties and other charges. 2011: The Corporation recorded a charge of $875 million ($525 million after income taxes) due to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges associated with its decision to shut down the refinery. The Corporation’s share of the impairment related losses recorded by HOVENSA represented an amount equivalent to the Corporation’s financial support to HOVENSA at December 31, 2011, its planned future funding commitments for costs related to the refinery shutdown, and a charge of $135 million for the write-off of related assets held by the subsidiary which owns the Corporation’s investment in HOVENSA. A deferred income tax benefit of $350 million, consisting primarily of U.S. income taxes, was recorded on the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s impairment and refinery shutdown related charges. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporation’s liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2013 2012 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,814 $ 642 Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt $ 378 $ 787 Total debt $ 5,798 $ 8,111 Total equity $ 24,784 $ 21,203 Debt to capitalization ratio* 19.0 % 27.7 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. 31 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Cash flows from operating activities Cash provided by operating activities — continuing operations $ 3,589 $ 5,573 $ 4,910 Cash provided by operating activities — discontinued operations 1,281 87 74 Net cash provided by operating activities 4,870 5,660 4,984 Cash flows from investing activities Capital expenditures (5,840 ) (7,743 ) (6,941 ) Proceeds from asset sales 4,458 843 490 Other, net (224 ) (60 ) (50 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities — continuing operations (1,606 ) (6,960 ) (6,501 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities — discontinued operations 2,184 (91 ) (65 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 578 (7,051 ) (6,566 ) Cash flows from financing activities Cash provided by (used in) financing activities — continuing operations (4,274 ) 1,684 327 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities — discontinued operations (2 ) (2 ) (2 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (4,276 ) 1,682 325 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,172 $ 291 $ (1,257 ) Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4,870 million in 2013 compared with $5,660 million in 2012, reflecting decreases in cash flows from changes in working capital. Operating cash flow increased to $5,660 million in 2012 from $4,984 million in 2011 principally reflecting higher operating earnings and increases in cash flows from changes in working capital. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 602 $ 619 $ 869 Production and development 5,051 6,790 4,673 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 56 267 1,346 Total Exploration and Production 5,709 7,676 6,888 Retail Marketing and Other 73 61 50 Corporate 58 6 3 Total capital expenditures — continuing operations 5,840 7,743 6,941 Downstream businesses — discontinued operations 33 52 65 Total capital expenditures $ 5,873 $ 7,795 $ 7,006 The decrease in capital expenditures in 2013 as compared to 2012 was mainly due to reduced capital expenditures in the Bakken, resulting from fewer drilling rigs being operated in the field as well as lower costs per well, and at the Valhall Field following the completion of the redevelopment project in January 2013 as well as asset sales. The increased spend on capital expenditures in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflected additional spending at the Bakken oil shale play as a result of more drilling rigs operated in the field, higher working interest wells and increased spending on field infrastructure projects. Capital expenditures in 2011 included acquisitions of approximately $800 million for 195,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in Ohio, $214 million for interests in two blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and $116 million for an additional 4% interest in the South Arne Field in Denmark. 32 Table of Contents Total proceeds from the sale of E&P assets was approximately $4.5 billion in 2013, $843 million in 2012 and $490 million in 2011. Completed sales in 2013 included the Corporation’s interests in the Beryl, ACG, Eagle Ford and Natuna A fields, its Russian subsidiary, Samara-Nafta, and proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion from the sale of the Corporation’s energy marketing operations and its U.S. East Coast terminal network, St. Lucia terminal and related businesses. Financing Activities: During 2013, the Corporation repaid a net amount of $2,348 million under available credit facilities and repaid $136 million of other debt. The net repayments under the credit facilities consisted of $990 million on the Corporation’s short-term credit facilities, $758 million on its syndicated revolving credit facility and $600 million on its asset backed credit facility. During 2012, the Corporation borrowed a net of $1,845 million from available credit facilities, which consisted of borrowings of $758 million from its syndicated revolving credit facility, $890 million from its short-term credit facilities and $250 million from its asset-backed credit facility, partially offset by net repayments of other debt of $53 million. During 2011, net borrowings on available credit facilities were $422 million. In 2013, the Corporation used approximately $1.5 billion of cash from the proceeds of its asset divestiture program, for the repurchase of common shares under a board authorized $4 billion repurchase plan. Total common stock dividends paid were $235 million in 2013, $171 million in 2012 and $136 million in 2011. In the third quarter of 2013, the Corporation increased its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per common share, from $0.10 per share. In 2012, the Corporation made five quarterly common stock dividend payments as a result of accelerating payment of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend, which historically would have been paid in the first quarter of 2013. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $128 million, $11 million and $88 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $5.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2014 for E&P operations and approximately $350 million for retail marketing primarily for the acquisition of its partner’s interest in the WilcoHess joint venture. The Corporation expects to fund its 2014 projected cash flow deficit, including capital expenditures, dismantlement obligations, dividends, pension contributions, debt repayments and share repurchases under its Board authorized plan, with existing cash on-hand, cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales. Looking forward, the Corporation expects its continued production growth, driven largely by the Bakken, Valhall and Tubular Bells, to generate free cash flow post 2014 at $100 Brent prices. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including discontinuing stock repurchases, reducing its planned capital program, utilizing existing credit facilities, issuing debt and equity securities, and/or further asset sales. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2013: ExpirationDate Capacity Borrowings Letters ofCredit Issued Total Used AvailableCapacity (In millions) Revolving credit facility April 2016 $ 4,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,000 Committed lines Various* 1,640 — 274 274 1,366 Uncommitted lines Various* 136 — 136 136 — Total $ 5,776 $ — $ 410 $ 410 $ 5,366 * Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2015. The Corporation’s $410 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2013 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 23, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation has a $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in April 2016. This facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility bear interest at 1.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A fee of 0.25% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to 33 Table of Contents adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The Corporation also had a 364 day asset-backed-credit facility, which was terminated in September 2013. The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements, including the revolving credit facility, contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. At December 31, 2013, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $35.5 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $5.9 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2013. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2013: Total Payments Due by Period 2014 2015 and2016 2017 and2018 Thereafter (In millions) Total debt* $ 5,798 $ 378 $ 152 $ 147 $ 5,121 Operating leases 2,532 805 656 228 843 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 4,081 3,635 112 104 230 Capital expenditures and other investments 3,558 1,911 1,178 389 80 Operating expenses 1,157 787 304 60 6 Other liabilities 3,736 615 582 366 2,173 * At December 31, 2013, the Corporation’s debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.1%. Supply commitments include term purchase agreements at market prices for a portion of the gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail marketing system. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity on behalf of Direct Energy to supply contracted customers from its divested energy marketing business until the customer contracts transfer to Direct Energy, which is expected to be substantially complete in the first half of 2014. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 23, Risk Management and Trading Activities. These commitments were computed based predominately on year-end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporation’s planned capital expenditure program for 2014 that was contractually committed at December 31, 2013. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation is contingently liable under $117 million of letters of credit of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2013. 34 Table of Contents Off-balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $238 million at December 31, 2013 compared with $342 million at December 31, 2012. In connection with the planned divestiture of its retail operations, the Corporation plans to either buyout these leveraged leases or sublet the retail gas stations to the divested operations. The Corporation estimates that it will incur an after-tax charge of approximately $100 million in connection with a buyout or sublet of the leases. If these leases were included as debt, the Corporation’s December 31, 2013 debt to capitalization ratio would increase to 19.6% from 19.0%. See also Note 20, Guarantees and Contingencies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the U.S., principally in Europe (Norway, Denmark and France), Africa (Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Algeria and Ghana) and Asia and Other (Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Brunei, the Kurdistan region of Iraq and China). Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, acts of terrorism, tax law changes and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical 35 Table of Contents audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves. Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below, there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market-based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. Following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013, the Corporation has concluded that within its E&P segment it has two reporting units, Offshore and Onshore, consistent with the manner in which performance is assessed by the segment manager. Accordingly, the Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of each of its reporting units. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar onshore and offshore peer companies. The determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the 36 Table of Contents deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long-lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporation’s financial statements. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy-related commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. 37 Table of Contents Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporation’s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. To value derivatives that are characterized as Level 2 and 3, the Corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges, pricing services or broker quotes. These observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods, including internal extrapolation or interpolation, that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporation’s exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, the Corporation sold natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. 38 Table of Contents Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation’s long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. The Corporation’s strategy is reflected in its environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short-term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation assesses, monitors and takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. The Corporation is committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions mandates and the responsible management of GHG emissions at its facilities. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities, and although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year-end 2013, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $65 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was approximately $16 million in 2013 and $19 million in both 2012 and 2011. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards were approximately $100 million in 2013, $70 million in 2012 and $95 million in 2011. Forward-looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Business and Properties, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, asset sales, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward-looking information. These sections typically include statements with words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “guidance”, “could”, “may”, “should”, “would” or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. Forward-looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporation’s results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, risk management activities are referred to as corporate risk management activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership, that trades energy-related commodities, securities and derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. In November 2013, the Corporation completed the sale of its energy marketing business to Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc (Centrica). Certain derivative contracts, including new transactions following the closing date, (the “delayed transfer derivative contracts”) have not been transferred to Direct Energy, as required customer or regulatory consents have not been obtained. However, the agreement entered into between Hess and Direct Energy on the closing date transfers all economic risks and rewards of the energy marketing business, including the ownership of the 39 Table of Contents delayed transfer derivative contracts, to Direct Energy. As a result, the assets and liabilities related to the delayed transfer derivative contracts remain on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013 but changes in their fair value are offset based on the terms of the agreement between Hess and Direct Energy. The Corporation therefore has no market risk related to these delayed transfer derivative contracts and only retains credit risk exposure, which has been guaranteed by Centrica. It is expected that the transfer of these contracts will be substantially complete in the first half of 2014. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management. The Corporation’s risk management department also performs independent price verifications (IPV’s) of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: • Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. • Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy-related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Corporate Risk Management Activities Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does 40 Table of Contents business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed-rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation has entered into Brent crude oil fixed price swap contracts to hedge 25,000 boepd for calendar year 2014 at an average price of $109.12 per barrel. The Corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain of approximately $4 million at December 31, 2013. The Corporation’s outstanding long-term debt of $5,798 million, including current maturities, had a fair value of $6,641 million at December 31, 2013. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $160 million at December 31, 2013. A 15% increase in the rate of interest would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $150 million at December 31, 2013. Following is the value at risk for the Corporation’s risk management commodity derivatives activities associated with continuing operations, excluding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives described above: 2013 2012 (In millions) At December 31 $ 13 $ — Average 27 47 High 44 95 Low 13 — The increase in the value at risk for the Corporation’s risk management commodity derivatives activities at December 31, 2013 is primarily due to the new Brent crude oil cash flow hedge positions entered in December 2013 as described in Note 23, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading Activities Trading activities are conducted through a trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest that is currently for sale. The partnership intends to generate earnings through various strategies primarily using energy related commodities, securities and derivatives.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chief Executive Officer February 28, 2014 44 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries, and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /S/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP February 28, 2014 New York, New York 45 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Hess Corporation is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company that develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, the joint development area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and Norway. Transformation to a Pure Play Exploration and Production Company In the first quarter of 2013, the Corporation announced several initiatives to continue its transformation into a more focused pure play E&P company. These initiatives represented the culmination of a multi-year strategic transformation designed to deliver long-term, cash generative growth and increase returns to stockholders by focusing on lower risk, higher growth unconventional assets, exploiting existing discoveries by leveraging offshore drilling and project development capabilities, and executing a smaller, more targeted exploratory program. As part of its transformation, the Corporation sold during the period of 2012 through 2014 mature or lower margin E&P assets in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Norway, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom North Sea (UK), and certain interests onshore in the U.S. In addition, the transformation plan included fully exiting the Corporation’s Marketing and Refining (M&R) business, including its terminal, retail, energy marketing and energy trading operations, as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its Port Reading facility. HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50/50 joint venture between the Corporation’s subsidiary, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), had previously shut down its U.S. Virgin Islands refinery in January 2012 and continued operating solely as an oil storage terminal through the first quarter of 2015. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. As of December 31, 2014, all downstream businesses were sold or shutdown except for the energy trading joint venture, HETCO, which was sold in February 2015, and HOVENSA, which will be shut down in the first quarter of 2015. Proceeds from sales of assets in E&P and M&R during the period of 2012 through 2014 totaling $13.4 billion were used primarily to reinvest in the E&P business, repay debt, repurchase the Corporation’s common stock, and increase cash balances. In 2013, the Corporation’s board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to $4 billion of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock, and subsequently in 2014 increased the authorized repurchase plan to $6.5 billion. Through December 31, 2014, the Corporation has repurchased a total of approximately $5.26 billion of outstanding common stock. Response to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Decline in Crude Oil Prices Brent crude oil and West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices declined approximately 40 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to end the year at $57 per barrel and $53 per barrel, respectively. The Corporation has responded by reducing its planned 2015 capital and exploratory program to $4.7 billion, down 16 percent from $5.6 billion in 2014. As part of the 2015 capital program, the Corporation expects to spend $1.8 billion in the Bakken shale play compared with $2.2 billion in 2014, and reflects reducing the rig count from seventeen rigs in 2014 to an average of 9.5 rigs in 2015. The Corporation plans to actively pursue other cost savings, including cost reductions from service providers, and significantly moderate the pace of share repurchases in 2015 to preserve liquidity in the current oil price environment. Consolidated Net Income Net income was $2,317 million in 2014 compared with $5,052 million in 2013 and $2,025 million in 2012. Diluted earnings per share were $7.53 in 2014 compared with $14.82 in 2013 and $5.95 in 2012. Excluding items affecting comparability, net income was $1,308 million in 2014, $1,892 million in 2013, and $1,998 million in 2012. See the table of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 26. Exploration and Production The Corporation’s total proved reserves were 1,431 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2014 compared with 1,437 million boe at December 31, 2013 and 1,553 million boe at December 31, 2012. Proved reserves related to assets sold were 77 million boe in 2014, 140 million boe in 2013 and 83 million boe in 2012. E&P earnings were $2,098 million in 2014, $4,303 million in 2013 and $2,212 million in 2012. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 31, E&P net income was $1,556 million, $2,192 million and $2,256 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Average realized crude oil selling prices including the impact of 23 hedging were $92.17 per barrel in 2014, $98.48 in 2013 and $86.94 in 2012. Average realized natural gas selling prices were $6.04 per mcf in 2014, $6.64 in 2013 and $6.16 in 2012. Production averaged 329,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2014, 336,000 boepd in 2013 and 406,000 boepd in 2012. Excluding production from assets sold and Libya, pro forma production was 318,000 boepd in 2014, 269,000 boepd in 2013 and 268,000 boepd in 2012. The Corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 350,000 boepd and 360,000 boepd in 2015, excluding any contribution from Libya. The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2014: · In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged 83,000 boepd, an increase of 24% from 67,000 boepd in 2013, primarily due to ongoing field development and operations commencing at the expanded Tioga Gas Plant in late March 2014. During 2014, the Corporation operated an average of 17 rigs to drill 261 wells and complete 230 wells bringing the total operated production wells to 982 at December 31, 2014. Drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $7.3 million in 2014, down from $8.1 million in 2013. In 2015, the Corporation plans to operate an average of 9.5 rigs to drill 170 wells and bring 210 wells on production while reducing capital expenditures to $1.8 billion from $2.2 billion in 2014. Bakken production is forecast to average between 95,000 boepd and 105,000 boepd in 2015. · At the Valhall Field in Norway (Hess 64%), net production averaged 31,000 boepd during 2014 compared with 23,000 boepd in 2013. This increase reflected the impact of start-up operations following completion of a redevelopment project in 2013, ongoing drilling of production wells and higher facilities uptime. · At Block A‑18 of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), the operator, Carigali Hess Operating Company, continued drilling production wells and successfully installed a new wellhead platform in 2014. Production averaged 42,000 boepd in 2014 compared to 45,000 boepd in 2013, including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia. Further development drilling is planned for 2015 and the completion of a booster compression project is planned for early 2016. · At the Hess operated Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation achieved first production in November 2014 following completion of construction, installation and commissioning of offshore production facilities and subsea equipment. Three wells are currently producing with a fourth production well expected to be completed in 2015. Full year 2015 net production for Tubular Bells is expected to be in the range of 30,000 boepd to 35,000 boepd. · In the North Malay Basin (NMB), net production from the Early Production System averaged 40 million cubic feet per day during 2014 compared with 30 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter of 2013. First production from the Field commenced in October 2013 with the first condensate offtake occurring in November 2014. Full field development is scheduled to be completed in 2017 when net production is expected to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day. · At the South Arne Field (Hess 62%) offshore Denmark, the Corporation continued drilling operations in 2014 following the December 2013 start-up of its phrase three development project which comprised the installation of two new wellhead platforms and modifications to existing production facilities. Development drilling is planned to continue into 2015. · In the Utica shale, 38 wells were drilled, 36 wells were completed and 39 wells were brought into operation. Net production increased to approximately 13,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Corporation and its joint venture partner plan to operate two drilling rigs in 2015 to drill 20 – 25 wells and bring on production 25 – 30 wells. · In Libya, civil and political unrest has largely interrupted production and crude oil export capability since August 2013. At the WAHA fields (Hess 8%), the operator recommenced production in the third quarter of 2014 at a reduced rate and the Corporation was able to sell four tank cargos of crude oil by year-end. The Corporation’s net production from Libya averaged 4,000 boepd in 2014, 15,000 boepd in 2013 and 21,000 boepd in 2012. In December 2014 the Libyan National Oil Company declared force majeure with respect to the Waha fields and production is currently shut in. · In Ghana, the Corporation completed its three well appraisal program on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block, offshore Ghana. In 2015 the Corporation and its partners will continue to analyze data from both appraisal drilling and 3D seismic with an expected project sanction decision in 2016. · In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Corporation announced that together with its project co-owners it will proceed with the development of the Stampede project in the Gulf of Mexico. A two-rig drilling program is planned with 24 the first rig commencing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the second in 2016. First production is expected in 2018. · At the Equus project in the offshore Carnarvon Basin of Australia, the Corporation executed a non-binding letter of intent with a third-party liquefaction partner. Successful execution of a binding agreement with the third party liquefaction partner is necessary before the Corporation can execute a gas sales agreement and sanction development. · In the second quarter, the Corporation completed its first exploration well on the Shakrok block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (Hess 64%). The well encountered sub-commercial amounts of hydrocarbons and was expensed. Drilling activities have been suspended on the Shireen exploration well in the Dinarta Block and the Corporation is currently assessing its completion options. Liquidity, and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,464 million in 2014, $4,870 million in 2013 and $5,660 million in 2012. At December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,444 million, up from $1,814 million at December 31, 2013. Total debt was $5,987 million at December 31, 2014 and $5,798 million at December 31, 2013. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2014 was 21.2% compared with 19.0% at December 31, 2013. Capital and exploratory expenditures from continuing operations were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) United States Bakken $ 2,149 $ 2,231 $ 3,164 Other Onshore 731 766 735 Total Onshore 2,880 2,997 3,899 Offshore 765 865 870 Total United States 3,645 3,862 4,769 Europe 540 724 1,381 Africa 435 630 771 Asia and other 986 993 1,231 Total* 5,606 6,209 8,152 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 125 $ 192 $ 142 International 207 250 328 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 332 $ 442 $ 470 * Excludes capital expenditures related to discontinued operations of $431 million, $106 million and $113 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Corporation anticipates investing approximately $4.7 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2015 down from $5.6 billion in 2014. The decline reflects a planned reduction in the Corporation’s work program in response to the lower commodity price environment. 25 Consolidated Results of Operations The after‑tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions, except per share amounts) Exploration and Production $ 2,098 $ 4,303 $ 2,212 Corporate, Interest and Other (406 ) (443 ) (422 ) Net income from continuing operations attributable to Hess Corporation 1,692 3,860 1,790 Net income from discontinued operations attributable to Hess Corporation 625 1,192 235 Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,317 $ 5,052 $ 2,025 Net income attributable to Hess Corporation per share - Diluted $ 7.53 $ 14.82 $ 5.95 The following table summarizes, on an after‑tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 34. 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Exploration and Production $ 542 $ 2,111 $ (44 ) Corporate, Interest and Other (74 ) (26 ) — Discontinued operations 541 1,075 71 Total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods $ 1,009 $ 3,160 $ 27 In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after‑tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after‑tax basis and uses after‑tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after‑tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre‑tax amount. After‑tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre‑tax amounts. 26 Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporation’s E&P operations: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Revenues and Non-operating Income Sales and other operating revenues $ 10,737 $ 11,905 $ 12,245 Gains on asset sales, net 817 2,171 584 Other, net (46) (57) 99 Total revenues and non-operating income 11,508 14,019 12,928 Costs and Expenses Cost of products sold (excluding items shown separately below) 1,826 1,853 1,334 Operating costs and expenses 1,927 2,116 2,202 Production and severance taxes 275 372 550 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 840 1,031 1,070 General and administrative expenses 336 377 314 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3,210 2,671 2,853 Asset impairments — 289 582 Total costs and expenses 8,414 8,709 8,905 Results of operations before income taxes 3,094 5,310 4,023 Provision for income taxes 996 831 1,793 Net income 2,098 4,479 2,230 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests — 176 18 Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,098 $ 4,303 $ 2,212 Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 31, the changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, cost of products sold, cash operating costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling Prices: Average crude oil realized selling prices were $92.17 per boe in 2014, or 6% lower compared to 2013 primarily due to declines in the benchmark prices for Brent and West Texas Intermediary (WTI) crude oil. Average crude oil selling prices were 13% higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a combination of hedging losses realized in 2012, the second quarter 2013 sale of the Corporation’s subsidiary in Russia which realized significantly lower crude oil prices, and slightly higher average WTI benchmark prices in 2013. 27 The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 Crude oil - per barrel (including hedging) United States Onshore $ 80.67 $ 90.00 $ 84.78 Offshore 95.05 103.83 101.80 Total United States 86.48 95.50 92.32 Europe 104.21 88.03 74.14 Africa 97.31 108.70 89.02 Asia 89.71 107.40 107.45 Worldwide 92.17 98.48 86.94 Crude oil - per barrel (excluding hedging) United States Onshore $ 80.67 $ 89.81 $ 85.66 Offshore 92.22 103.15 104.39 Total United States 85.34 95.11 93.96 Europe 99.20 87.45 75.06 Africa 93.70 108.07 110.92 Asia 89.71 107.40 109.35 Worldwide 89.78 98.01 93.70 Natural gas liquids - per barrel United States Onshore $ 28.92 $ 43.14 $ 44.22 Offshore 30.40 29.18 35.24 Total United States 29.32 38.07 40.75 Europe 52.66 58.31 78.43 Asia — 74.94 77.92 Worldwide 30.59 40.68 47.81 Natural gas - per mcf United States Onshore $ 3.18 $ 3.08 $ 2.02 Offshore 3.79 2.83 2.15 Total United States 3.47 2.96 2.09 Europe 10.00 11.06 9.50 Asia and other 6.94 7.50 6.90 Worldwide 6.04 6.64 6.16 Crude oil price hedging contracts increased E&P Sales and other operating revenues by $193 million ($121 million after income taxes) and $39 million ($25 million after income taxes) in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and reduced E&P Sales and other operating revenues by $688 million ($431 million after income taxes) in 2012. Production Volumes: The Corporation’s crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was 329,000 boepd in 2014, 336,000 boepd in 2013 and 406,000 boepd in 2012. Production volumes associated with assets sold were 8,000 boepd in 2014, 52,000 boepd in 2013, and 117,000 boepd in 2012. Crude oil and natural gas liquids comprised 74%, 72% and 75% of the Corporation’s total production in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Corporation currently expects total worldwide production to average between 350,000 boepd and 360,000 boepd in 2015, excluding any contribution from Libya. 28 The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2014 2013 2012 (In thousands) Crude oil - barrels per day United States Bakken 66 55 47 Other Onshore 10 10 13 Total Onshore 76 65 60 Offshore 51 43 48 Total United States 127 108 108 Europe 36 44 84 Africa 54 62 75 Asia 3 11 17 Total 220 225 284 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day United States Bakken 10 6 5 Other Onshore 7 4 5 Total Onshore 17 10 10 Offshore 6 5 6 Total United States 23 15 16 Europe 1 1 2 Asia — 1 1 Total 24 17 19 Natural gas - mcf per day United States Bakken 40 38 27 Other Onshore 47 25 27 Total Onshore 87 63 54 Offshore 78 61 65 Total United States 165 124 119 Europe 36 23 43 Asia and other 312 418 454 Total 513 565 616 Barrels of oil equivalent - per day* 329 336 406 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. In addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices on page 28. United States: Crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2014 compared with 2013, a result of continued development of the Bakken oil shale play, higher production resulting from an active drilling program in the Utica Shale and a new production well combined with lower downtime at the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico. Crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was comparable in 2013 and 2012, as higher production from the Bakken oil shale play was partly offset by natural decline and maintenance in the other U.S. assets. Europe: Crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the April 2013 sale of the Corporation’s Russian subsidiary, partially offset by higher production during 2014 at the Vahall Field in Norway following completion of the redevelopment project in 2013. Higher natural gas production in 2014 compared to 2013 was a result of higher uptime from the Valhall Field. Crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to asset sales. The Bittern and Schiehallion fields in the UK North Sea, which were sold in the second half of 2012, were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 12,000 boepd at the time of sale. The Beryl fields, also in the UK North Sea, which were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 10,000 boepd at the time of sale, were sold in the first quarter of 2013, and the Corporation’s Russian subsidiary, which was producing approximately 50,000 boepd at the time of sale, was sold in April 2013. 29 Africa: Crude oil production in Africa was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, and from 2013 to 2012, primarily due to the shutdown of the Es Sider terminal in Libya in the third quarter of 2013, following civil unrest in the country. In December 2014 the Libyan National Oil Company declared force majeure with respect to the Waha fields and production is currently shut-in. The decline from 2013 compared to 2012 was also due to lower production from the Okume Complex in offshore Equatorial Guinea, which was partially offset by new production from the Ceiba Field. Asia and Other: Crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, largely as a result of the divestiture of the Corporation’s interests in the Pangkah Field in Indonesia in January 2014 and the Corporation’s interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields, Azerbaijan in March 2013. Natural gas production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 following the Corporation’s divestiture of its interests in Indonesia and Thailand in 2014 and lower production from the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), which was partially offset by a full year of production from the North Malay Basin. Crude oil production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to the sale in March 2013 of the Corporation’s interest in the ACG fields. Natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, mainly due to lower production entitlement at the JDA together with lower production at the Pangkah Field in Indonesia. Sales Volumes: The Corporation’s worldwide sales volumes were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 (In thousands) Crude oil - barrels 80,869 82,402 101,770 Natural gas liquids - barrels 8,793 6,244 7,138 Natural gas - mcf 187,381 206,122 225,607 Barrels of oil equivalent* 120,892 123,000 146,510 Crude oil - barrels per day 222 226 278 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day 24 17 19 Natural gas - mcf per day 513 565 616 Barrels of oil equivalent per day* 331 337 400 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. In addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices on page 28. Cost of Products Sold: Cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from the Corporation’s partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties. Cost of products sold in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased volumes purchased from partners in wells operated by the Corporation being offset by lower purchases from third parties. The increase in Cost of products sold in 2013 compared with 2012 principally reflected higher volumes of crude oil purchases from third parties. Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of Operating costs and expenses, Production and severance taxes and General and administrative expenses, decreased by approximately $330 million in 2014 compared with 2013 and decreased by approximately $200 million in 2013 compared with 2012. The decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects lower production taxes and operating costs following the divestitures of Indonesia and Thailand assets in early 2014 and the Corporation’s interests in Russia in April 2013, as well as lower employee costs. The decrease in 2013 was due to lower production taxes following the sale of the Corporation’s Russian operations, and reductions in transportation costs, lease operating expenses and employee costs, which were partially offset by severance charges and other exit costs incurred as part of the Corporation’s transformation to a more focused E&P company. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by approximately $540 million in 2014 and decreased by $182 million in 2013, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increase in 2014 was primarily associated with higher production volumes from the Bakken, Utica, Valhall, and North Malay Basin, each of which had a DD&A rate higher than the portfolio average in 2014. The decrease in 2013 largely reflects asset sales and the mix of production volumes. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table below, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) were $21.03 in 2014, $22.63 in 2013 and $20.63 in 2012 and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per boe were $26.68 in 2014, $21.61 in 2013 and $19.20 in 2012. Total production unit costs were $47.71 per boe in 2014, $44.24 per boe in 2013 and $39.83 per boe in 2012. 30 For 2015, cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of $19.50 to $20.50 per boe and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of $28.50 to $29.50 per boe, resulting in total production unit costs of $48.00 to $50.00 per boe assuming no contribution from Libya. Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, were lower in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. Exploration expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and geological and seismic expenses partly offset by higher leasehold impairment expenses. Income Taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 41% in 2014, 43% in 2013 and 45% in 2012. The decline in the effective income tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 and in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of shut‑in production in Libya from the third quarter of 2013. Based on current strip crude oil prices, we are forecasting a pre-tax loss for 2015 and, as a result, the E&P effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 38% to 42% excluding Libyan operations. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Gains on asset sales, net $ 801 $ 2,195 $ 584 $ 774 $ 2,145 $ 557 Noncontrolling interest share of gain on asset sale — (168 ) — — (168 ) — Dry hole and related expenses (169 ) (260 ) (86 ) (105 ) (163 ) (56 ) Leasehold impairment expenses (135 ) (327 ) (582 ) (68 ) (210 ) (344 ) Employee severance and exit costs (28 ) (129 ) — (11 ) (117 ) — Income taxes — — — (48 ) 624 (201 ) $ 469 $ 1,311 $ (84 ) $ 542 $ 2,111 $ (44 ) 2014: In April 2014, the Corporation completed the sale of its Thailand assets for cash proceeds of approximately $805 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $706 million ($706 million after income taxes). The assets in Thailand were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 19,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 45 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2013. During 2014, the Corporation sold approximately 77,000 net acres, including related wells and facilities, in the dry gas area of the Utica shale play, for total cash proceeds of approximately $1,075 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $62 million ($35 million after income taxes). Production and proved reserves from the disposed Utica acreage were not material. In the third quarter, the Corporation completed the sale of an exploration asset in the United Kingdom North Sea, for cash proceeds of $53 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $33 million ($33 million after income taxes). In 2014, the Corporation recorded dry hole and other exploration expenses for the write-off of a previously capitalized exploration well in the western half of Block 469 in the Gulf of Mexico of $169 million ($105 million after income taxes) and other charges totaling $135 million pre-tax ($68 million after income taxes) to write-off leasehold acreage in the Paris Basin of France, the Shakrok Block in Kurdistan and the Corporation’s interest in a natural gas exploration project, offshore Sabah, Malaysia.

In addition, the Corporation recorded an income tax charge of $48 million for remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from legal entity restructurings. 2013: In the fourth quarter, the Corporation announced the sale of its Indonesian assets for after‑tax proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The sale was executed in two separate transactions with the sale of Natuna A completing in December 2013 and the sale of Pangkah closing in January 2014, as a result of a partner exercising their preemptive rights. The sale of Natuna A, which had sales proceeds of approximately $656 million, resulted in a pre‑tax gain of $388 million ($343 million after income taxes). The Natuna Field was producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 5,500 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 21 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2012. In April, the Corporation completed the sale of its Russian subsidiary, Samara‑Nafta, for cash proceeds of $2.1 billion after working capital and other adjustments. Based on the Corporation’s 90% interest in Samara‑Nafta, after‑tax proceeds to Hess were approximately $1.9 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,119 million ($1,119 million after income taxes), which was reduced by $168 million for the noncontrolling interest holder’s share of the gain, resulting in a net gain attributable to the 31 Corporation of $951 million. Samara‑Nafta was producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 50,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 82 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2012. In the first quarter of 2013, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Beryl fields in the UK North Sea for cash proceeds of $442 million, resulting in a pre‑tax gain of $328 million ($323 million after income taxes) and the sale of its interests in the Azeri‑Chirag‑Guneshli (ACG) fields, offshore Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea, for cash proceeds of $884 million, resulting in a pre‑tax gain of $360 million ($360 million after income taxes). These assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 16,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 38 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2012. In December 2013, the Corporation recorded dry hole costs of $260 million ($163 million after income taxes) associated with Area 54, offshore Libya due to continued civil unrest in the country. In addition, during 2013, the Corporation recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling $327 million ($210 million after income taxes). These impairment charges consisted of $289 million ($187 million after income taxes) related to Pangkah to adjust its carrying value to its fair value at December 31, 2013 and $38 million ($23 million after income taxes) to write‑off the Corporation’s leasehold acreage in the Marcellus, onshore U.S. In 2013, the Corporation recorded net pre‑tax charges of $129 million ($117 million after income taxes) for severance, non‑cash charges associated with the cessation of use of certain leased office space and other exit costs, resulting from its planned divestitures and transformation into a more focused pure play E&P company. In December 2013, Denmark enacted a new hydrocarbon income tax law that resulted in a combination of changes to tax rates, revisions to the amount of uplift allowed on capital expenditures and special transition rules. As a consequence of the tax law change, the Corporation recorded a deferred tax asset of $674 million. In addition, during 2013, the Corporation recorded a non‑cash income tax charge of $28 million as a result of a planned asset divestiture and a charge of $22 million relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings. 2012: The Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Schiehallion Field (Hess 16%) and the Bittern Field (Hess 28%), which are both located in the UK North Sea, as well as the Snohvit Field (Hess 3%), offshore Norway, for total cash proceeds of $843 million. These transactions resulted in pre‑tax gains totaling $584 million ($557 million after income taxes). These assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 15,000 boepd at the time of sale and had a total of 83 million boe of proved reserves at December 31, 2011. The Corporation recorded asset impairment charges totaling $582 million ($344 million after income taxes). These impairment charges consisted of $374 million ($228 million after income taxes) associated with the divestiture of assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and $208 million ($116 million after income taxes) related to non‑producing properties in the UK North Sea. In 2012, the Corporation decided to cease further development and appraisal activities in Peru. As a result, the Corporation recorded exploration expenses totaling $86 million ($56 million after income taxes) to write‑off its exploration assets in the country. In July 2012, the government of the UK changed the supplementary income tax rate applicable to deductions for dismantlement expenditures to 20% from 32%. As a result, the Corporation recorded a one‑time charge in the third quarter of 2012 of $115 million for deferred taxes related to asset retirement obligations in the UK. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Corporation recorded an income tax charge of $86 million for a disputed application of an international tax treaty. 32 Corporate, Interest and Other The following table summarizes corporate, interest and other expenses: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Corporate and Other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 217 $ 263 $ 267 Interest expense 399 466 447 Less: Capitalized interest (76 ) (60 ) (28 ) Interest expense, net 323 406 419 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes 540 669 686 Income taxes (benefits) (208 ) (252 ) (264 ) Net Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes 332 417 422 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after-tax 74 26 — Total Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes $ 406 $ 443 $ 422 Corporate expenses were lower in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting lower employee related costs, contract labor and professional fees.

After‑tax corporate expenses in 2015 are estimated to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million, compared with after-tax corporate expenses of $134 million, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in 2014. Interest expense, net was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting lower average outstanding debt, lower letter of credit fees and higher capitalized interest. The decrease in 2013 interest expense, net compared with 2012 primarily reflects higher capitalized interest related to the Tubular Bells and North Malay Basin projects. After‑tax interest expense in 2015 is expected to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million, compared with after-tax interest expenses of $202 million in 2014. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported Corporate, interest and other expenses included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Write down of equity investment $ (84) $ — $ — $ (52) $ — $ — Employee severance (19) (21) — (12) (13) — Facility and other exit costs (15) (19) — (10) (13) — $ (118) $ (40) $ — $ (74) $ (26) $ — The Corporation recorded a charge of $84 million ($52 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its investment in the Bayonne Energy Center to fair value.

Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations attributable to Hess Corporation had income of $625 million in 2014, $1,192 million in 2013, and $235 million in 2012 which comprised the Corporation’s retail, energy marketing, terminal, energy trading and refining operations. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below, discontinued operations generated adjusted net income of $84 million in 2014, $117 million in 2013, and $164 million in 2012. Discontinued operations results reflect ownership of its energy trading partnership through December 2014, retail marketing through September 2014, terminals through December 2013, energy marketing through November 2013 and Port Reading refining activities through the date it was permanently shut down in February 2013. 33 Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported earnings for discontinued operations included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Gains on asset sales $ 982 $ 1,500 $ — $ 620 $ 995 $ — LIFO inventory liquidations 275 678 165 171 414 104 Gain recognized on acquisition of controlling interest in equity investee 39 — — 24 — — Environmental, exit and other charges (211 ) (230 ) — (141 ) (154 ) — Asset impairments (50 ) (80 ) (43) (31 ) (51 ) (33 ) Charge for termination of lease contracts for retail gasoline stations (115 ) — — (72 ) — — Employee severance (41 ) (131 ) — (26 ) (80 ) — Port Reading refinery shutdown costs (6 ) (82 ) — (4 ) (49 ) — $ 873 $ 1,655 $ 122 $ 541 $ 1,075 $ 71 2014: In September, the Corporation completed the sale of its retail business for cash proceeds of approximately $2.8 billion.

Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporation’s cash flows: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Cash flows from operating activities Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations $ 4,511 $ 3,708 $ 5,521 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities - discontinued operations (47 ) 1,162 139 Net cash provided by operating activities 4,464 4,870 5,660 Cash flows from investing activities Capital expenditures (5,274 ) (5,767 ) (7,682 ) Proceeds from asset sales 2,978 4,458 843 Other, net (139 ) (227 ) (64 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations (2,435 ) (1,536 ) (6,903 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities - discontinued operations 2,436 2,114 (148 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 1 578 (7,051 ) Cash flows from financing activities Cash provided by (used in) financing activities - continuing operations (3,828 ) (4,266 ) 1,685 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities - discontinued operations (7 ) (10 ) (3 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (3,835 ) (4,276 ) 1,682 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 630 $ 1,172 $ 291 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4,464 million in 2014 compared with $4,870 million in 2013, reflecting the impact of changes in working capital, lower operating earnings primarily as a result of asset sales and the decline in benchmark crude oil prices. Operating cash flow decreased to $4,870 million in 2013 from $5,660 million in 2012 principally reflecting decreases in cash flows from asset sales and changes in working capital. 35 Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporation’s capital expenditures: 2014 2013 2012 (In millions) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 431 $ 602 $ 619 Production and development 4,702 5,051 6,790 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 88 56 267 Total Exploration and Production 5,221 5,709 7,676 Corporate 53 58 6 Total capital expenditures - continuing operations 5,274 5,767 7,682 Downstream businesses - discontinued operations 431 106 113 Total capital expenditures $ 5,705 $ 5,873 $ 7,795 The decrease in capital expenditures in 2014, as compared with 2013, is largely due to the ongoing reduction in capital expenditures in the Bakken, reflecting lower well costs and completion of the Tioga gas plant expansion project. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2013 as compared to 2012 was mainly due to reduced capital expenditures in the Bakken, resulting from fewer drilling rigs being operated in the field as well as lower costs per well. In addition, completion of the redevelopment project at the Valhall Field in January 2013 as well as asset sales reduced 2013 capital expenditures. Total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to approximately $3.0 billion in 2014, $4.5 billion in 2013 and $0.8 billion in 2012. In 2014, the Corporation completed asset sales of its dry gas acreage in the Utica shale play, its assets in Thailand, the Pangkah Field, offshore Indonesia, and its interests in two power plant joint ventures. Completed sales in 2013 included the Corporation’s interests in the Beryl, ACG, Eagle Ford and Natuna A fields, and its Russian subsidiary, Samara‑Nafta. In 2014, net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations included proceeds of $2.8 billion from the sale of the retail business. In addition, the Corporation acquired in January 2014, its partners’ 56% interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline joint venture, for approximately $290 million. In June 2014, the Corporation incurred capital expenditures of $105 million related to the acquisition of previously leased retail gasoline stations. Both of these transactions were undertaken in connection with the Corporation’s divestiture of its retail business. Net cash provided by investing activities related to discontinued operations for 2013 includes proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion from the sales of the Corporation’s energy marketing operations and its U.S. East Coast terminal network, St. Lucia terminal and related businesses. Financing Activities: During 2014, the Corporation issued $600 million ($598 million net of discount) of unsecured, fixed rate notes and repaid $590 million of debt, including $250 million of unsecured, fixed rate notes, $74 million assumed in the acquisition of WilcoHess, and $249 million for the payment of various lease obligations primarily related to the retirement of the Corporation’s retail gasoline station leases. In 2013, the Corporation repaid $2,348 million, net under available credit facilities and repaid $136 million of other debt. The net repayments under the credit facilities consisted of $990 million on the Corporation’s short‑term credit facilities, $758 million on its syndicated revolving credit facility and $600 million on its asset backed credit facility. During 2012, the Corporation borrowed a net of $1,845 million from available credit facilities, which consisted of borrowings of $758 million from its syndicated revolving credit facility, $890 million from its short‑term credit facilities and $250 million from its asset‑backed credit facility, partially offset by net repayments of other debt of $53 million. The Corporation repurchased Hess common stock of approximately $3.7 billion in 2014 and approximately $1.5 billion in 2013 under its $6.5 billion board authorized stock repurchase plan. Total common stock dividends paid were $303 million in 2014, $235 million in 2013 and $171 million in 2012. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $182 million, $128 million and $11 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 36 Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing approximately $4.7 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2015 compared to $5.6 billion in 2014. Based on current strip crude oil prices, the Corporation forecasts in 2015 a significant net loss and net cash flow deficit after funding planned capital expenditures, dismantlement obligations, pension contributions, dividends and any share repurchases under its Board authorized plan. The Corporation expects to fund its 2015 net cash flow deficit with existing cash on hand of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2014 and, if necessary, borrowings under its long-term credit facility. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporation’s capital expenditure program could occur. The Corporation plans to preserve its financial flexibility and to improve its cash flow by pursuing cost reductions from vendors, significantly moderating stock repurchases compared with 2014, and depending on where crude oil prices trend, potentially further reducing its planned capital program. In addition, should needs dictate, the Corporation may also access other sources of liquidity by utilizing other existing uncommitted credit facilities, issuing debt and equity securities, and/or pursuing further asset sales. The Corporation held $1.1 billion of its year-end 2014 total cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion outside of the U.S. and has the ability to bring its December 31, 2014 international cash balance back to the U.S. without triggering a U.S. cash tax liability. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporation’s borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2014: Expiration Date Capacity Borrowings Letters of Credit Issued Total Used Available Capacity (In millions) Revolving credit facility January 2020 $ 4,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,000 Committed lines Various* 1,175 — 25 25 1,150 Uncommitted lines Various* 372 — 372 372 — Total $ 5,547 $ — $ 397 $ 397 $ 5,150 * Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2020. The Corporation’s $397 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2014 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 21, Financial Risk Management and Trading Activities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2014, the Corporation had a $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility with a maturity date of April 2016. In January 2015, the Corporation entered into a new $4 billion five‑year credit agreement with a maturity date of January 2020. This facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the new facility bear interest at 1.075% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A fee of 0.175% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The Corporation’s long‑term debt agreements, including the revolving credit facility, contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. The most restrictive of these covenants allow the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $5.6 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2014. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Promptly after filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as a result of the Corporation’s existing shelf registration statement expiring on February 27, 2015, the Corporation anticipates filing a new shelf registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which it may issue, among other things, additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporation’s debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporation’s credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from financial risk management counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. 37 Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2014: Payments Due by Period Total 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 and 2019 Thereafter (In millions) Total debt (excludes interest)* $ 5,987 $ 68 $ 444 $ 1,148 $ 4,327 Operating leases 2,818 773 1,049 651 345 Purchase obligations: Capital expenditures 3,500 2,246 1,019 194 41 Operating expenses 1,306 451 436 278 141 Asset retirement obligations 2,723 442 419 222 1,640 Transportation and related contracts 1,738 124 355 451 808 Other liabilities 1,177 138 115 116 808 * The Corporation anticipates cash payments for interest of $355 million for 2015, $722 million for 2016-2017, $680 million for 2018-2019, and $4,265 million thereafter for a total of $6,022 million. Capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at December 31, 2014, including the portion of the Corporation’s planned capital expenditure program for 2015. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other long‑term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, lease drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation is contingently liable under $54 million of letters of credit at December 31, 2014. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation had leveraged leases associated with certain retail gasoline stations which were not included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet and had a fair value of approximately $238 million at December 31, 2013. If these leases were included as debt, the Corporation’s December 31, 2013 debt to capitalization ratio would have increased to 19.6% from 19.0%. The leases were terminated in 2014 in conjunction with the anticipated divestiture of retail marketing that closed in September 2014. See also Note 18, Guarantees and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the U.S., principally in Europe (Norway and Denmark), Africa (Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Algeria and Ghana) and Asia and Other (Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, China, Guyana and Canada). Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, corruption, acts of terrorism, tax law changes and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. 38 Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporation’s total proved reserves each year. Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period before December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices remained at significantly higher levels during the first ten months of 2014 and declined during the last two months of the year. As a result, the average crude oil price used to calculate proved reserves at December 31, 2014 is significantly higher than the year-end 2014 crude oil price. The year-end 2015 reserve estimates will be based on the same unweighted arithmetic average formula using first-day-of-the-month prices for 2015 and will reflect the current low crude oil price environment from the beginning of the year. If current strip crude oil prices hold through 2015, proved reserves at December 31, 2015 could be significantly lower than proved reserves at December 31, 2014. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any net negative change in proved reserves that may result from lower crude oil prices due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2015 crude oil prices, any revisions in proved reserves that may occur based on 2015 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will decline in response to lower prices, and management’s plans as of December 31, 2015 for developing proved undeveloped reserves through the year 2020 which will be the five-year window for recognizing proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. Despite the uncertainties cited, based on facts and assumptions existing at December 31, 2014 if Brent crude oil prices were to average $60 per barrel in 2015, the Corporation estimates that 2015 depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses would increase by not more than $75 million, after-tax as a result of changes in proved reserves compared with December 31, 2014. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 87 through 95 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves. 39 Impairment of Long-lived Assets: The Corporation reviews long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporation’s impairment tests of long‑lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Corporation tested its oil and gas properties for impairment and determined no impairment existed at December 31, 2014. Impairment of Goodwill: The Corporation’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. Following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013, the Corporation concluded that within its E&P segment it has two reporting units, offshore and onshore, consistent with the manner in which performance is assessed by the Operating segment manager. In step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Corporation performs step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination. The resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded. The Corporation’s fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control and increased market share. The determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar peer companies, and other market data if available, in determining fair value of a reporting unit. In addition, a qualitative reconciliation of the Corporation’s market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two. If a reporting unit fails step one, it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value, or one or more assets of the reporting unit having taxable temporary differences that result in recognition of goodwill for the reporting unit under purchase accounting requirements in a business combination. 40 As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset. Crude oil prices declined significantly following the date of the Corporation’s annual goodwill impairment test on October 1, 2014. In addition, the Corporation’s stock price decreased to a level at December 31, 2014 that resulted in the Corporation’s book value exceeding its market capitalization by 6%. As a result of these potential indicators of impairment, the Corporation performed a separate goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2014. The offshore and onshore reporting units, which have allocated goodwill of $1,098 million and $760 million, respectively at December 31, 2014, each passed step one of the impairment test. However, the onshore reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 5%. While not required, the Corporation performed a hypothetical step two test for the onshore reporting unit and estimated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value. Accordingly, the Corporation expects that the benefits of its goodwill totaling $1,858 million will be recovered through the operations of each of its reporting units based on market conditions at December 31, 2014. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation considers the reversal of temporary differences, the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporation’s internal business forecasts. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporation’s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded post-retirement medical plan. The Corporation recognizes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long‑term rates of return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels, and participant mortality assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporation’s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, 41 while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporation’s financial statements. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both financial risk management and trading activities. In financial risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy‑related commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. The energy trading joint venture, HETCO, was sold in the first quarter of 2015. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. The Corporation’s fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporation’s credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. To value derivatives that are characterized as Level 2 and 3, the Corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges, pricing services or broker quotes. These observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods, including internal extrapolation or interpolation, that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. 42 Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over‑the‑counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation’s long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. The Corporation’s strategy is reflected in its environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporation’s management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation assesses, monitors and takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. The Corporation is committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions mandates and the responsible management of GHG emissions at its facilities. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities, sites from discontinued operations as to which the Corporation retained liability and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year‑end 2014, the Corporation’s reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation’s remediation spending was approximately $12 million in 2014, $16 million in 2013 and $19 million in 2012. The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of the Corporation’s capital expenditures and operating expenses. Forward-looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, including Business and Properties, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporation’s future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, asset sales, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off‑balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward‑looking information. These sections typically include statements with words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “guidance”, “could”, “may”, “should”, “would” or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. Forward‑looking disclosures are based on the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporation’s results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. 43 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As discussed in Note 21, Financial Risk Management and Trading Activities, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation is exposed in the normal course of its business to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. The Corporation is also exposed to commodity price risks primarily related to crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as foreign currency values, from its 50% voting interest in a consolidated energy trading joint venture, HETCO, which was sold in the first quarter of 2015. In conjunction with the Corporation’s sale of its energy marketing business in the fourth quarter of 2013, certain derivative contracts, including new transactions following the closing date, (the “delayed transfer derivative contracts”) were not transferred to the acquirer, Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc (Centrica), as required customer or regulatory consents had not been obtained. However, the agreement entered into between Hess and Direct Energy on the closing date transferred all economic risks and rewards of the energy marketing business, including the ownership of the delayed transfer derivative contracts, to Direct Energy. The transfer of these remaining contracts was completed during the third quarter of 2014. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management. The Corporation’s financial risk management department also performs independent price verifications (IPV’s) of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporation’s financial risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading joint venture. The Corporation’s treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Value at Risk: The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its financial risk management and trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in financial risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its financial risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: ● Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. ● Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound and Danish Krone which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. ● Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. ● Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its financial risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. ● Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. ● Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy‑related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. 44 Financial Risk Management Activities Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporation’s crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed‑rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $120 million at December 31, 2014. The Corporation’s outstanding long‑term debt of $5,987 million, including current maturities, had a fair value of $7,003 million at December 31, 2014. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $485 million at December 31, 2014. A 15% increase in the rate of interest would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $430 million at December 31, 2014.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chief Executive Officer February 26, 2015 48 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries, and our report dated February 26, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York February 26, 2015 49 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.

Risk Factors Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below. These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, liquidity, financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets. Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions, the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally. At December 31, 2015, spot prices for Brent crude oil and West Texas Intermediate crude oil closed at $36.61 per barrel and $37.13 per barrel, respectively. Average prices for 2015 were $53.64 per barrel for Brent and $48.80 per barrel for WTI. If crude oil prices in 2016 remain at levels consistent with or below year-end 2015, there will be a significant decrease in 2016 revenues and operating results from 2015 levels. We cannot predict how long these lower price levels will continue to prevail. The sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price. In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain significant bank credit facilities. An inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility. If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Similar risks, however, may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement, replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices, such as those currently prevailing, may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. Crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 resulting in a significant reduction to our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. If crude oil prices remain at current levels or decline further, it could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the 14 value of our business. See Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. We transport some of our crude oil production, particularly from the Bakken shale oil play, by rail. Recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny. In the wake of these accidents, several U.S. government agencies have issued safety advisories or emergency orders requiring rail carriers to take additional precautionary measures when shipping crude oil by rail. In 2015, the Department of Transportation issued new standards for tank car design which could require HIP to retrofit or upgrade its existing fleet of tank cars. The requirements of these new regulatory actions, as well as other possible regulations or voluntary measures by the rail industry aimed at increasing rail safety, may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. For example, in 2015, we had a net loss attributable to Hess Corporation of $3,056 million, and if commodity prices remain low through 2016, we are forecasting a net loss for 2016. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. In January 2016, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed our BBB credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative. In February 2016, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered our credit rating to Ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade. Although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, further ratings downgrades, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, geographic territorial border disputes, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political and civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new 15 regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is used to produce petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‑made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, such as the third-party accident at the Macondo prospect, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‑attacks. Although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions. This may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows. Departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. The derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management. Moreover, an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, with a commensurate impact on shareholder value. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. An inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost. These consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. We manage commodity price risk through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. In addition, as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. Cyber‑attacks targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry 16 may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners. Cyber‑attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A cyber‑attack against these operating systems, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, a cyber-attack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition, as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We, along with many companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state, have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been removed to Federal court and has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. The suit filed in Vermont is proceeding there in a state court. An action brought by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was settled in conjunction with the Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation of HOVENSA’s Liquidation Plan, which is described below. We received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower Passaic River and the NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and also agreed with EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. The EPA is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the River. To that end, in April 2014 EPA issued a Focused Feasibility Study (“FFS”) proposing to conduct bank-to-bank dredging of the lower eight miles of the Passaic River at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. EPA may issue a Record of Decision (“ROD”) in 2016 selecting a remedy for the lower eight miles based on the FFS, but the ultimate remedy (and associated cost) for the lower Passaic River remains uncertain at this stage. The ROD is unlikely to address an additional nine miles of the Passaic River, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given the ongoing studies and the fact that EPA has not yet selected a remedy for part or all of the lower Passaic River, remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. The remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. EPA has estimated that this remedy will cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal adjacent to the Canal. We indicated to EPA that we would comply with the Administrative Order and are currently contributing funding for the Remedial Design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties. At the same time, we are participating in an allocation process whereby neutral experts selected by the parties will determine the 17 final shares of the Remedial Design costs to be paid by each of the participants. The parties have not yet addressed the allocation of costs associated with implementing the remedy that is currently being designed. In May 2005, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands filed a complaint in the District Court of the Virgin Islands against HOVENSA LLC (“HOVENSA”), a 50/50 joint venture between our subsidiary, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (“HOVIC”), and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix asserting that the defendants are liable under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources. In 2014, HOVIC, HOVENSA and the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which HOVENSA paid $3.5 million and agreed to pay the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands an additional $40 million no later than December 31, 2014. On September 15, 2015, HOVENSA filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States District Court of the Virgin Islands - Bankruptcy Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”) and commenced a court-supervised sale of substantially all of its assets pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. To fund HOVENSA's sale process and orderly wind-down, HOVENSA entered into a $40 million debtor-in-possession credit facility with HOVENSA’s owners, the terms of which were approved by the Bankruptcy Court. On December 1, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the sale of HOVENSA’s terminal and refinery assets to Limetree Bay Terminals, LLC (“Limetree”). The Senate of the U.S. Virgin Islands approved the sale in December 2015, and the sale to Limetree was completed on January 4, 2016. The $40 million claim held by the U.S. Virgin Islands government against HOVENSA on account of the 2014 settlement agreement was also paid from the sale proceeds. On January 19, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming HOVENSA’s Chapter 11 plan of liquidation (the “Liquidation Plan”). Under the Liquidation Plan, which became effective February 17, 2016, HOVENSA established a liquidating trust to distribute certain assets and sale proceeds to its creditors, established an environmental response trust to administer to HOVENSA’s remaining environmental obligations and will conduct an orderly wind-down of its remaining activities. The Liquidation Plan also provides for releases of any claims held by HOVENSA and its bankruptcy estate against us and HOVIC, and releases any claims held by certain third-party creditors of HOVENSA against us and HOVIC, both effective upon the effective date of the Liquidation Plan. In connection with the Liquidation Plan and HOVENSA’s asset sale, HOVIC relinquished its claims against HOVENSA on account of promissory notes issued by HOVENSA to HOVIC. On September 13, 2015, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands filed a complaint against us in the territorial Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix, alleging, among other things, that we violated territorial statutes and committed various torts in connection with the 50% ownership interest of our subsidiary, HOVIC, in HOVENSA. In connection with the closing of HOVENSA’s asset sale to Limetree, we, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, HOVIC, HOVENSA, and PDVSA entered into a mutual release agreement that resulted in the dismissal, with prejudice, of all pending litigation among those parties, including the lawsuit filed by the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands against us and various tax refund lawsuits filed by HOVIC and PDVSA against the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands. As part of this agreement, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands also granted us, HOVIC, and HOVENSA a general release of all other existing claims, with the exception of claims related to environmental matters, which were automatically released upon the establishment of the environmental response trust in connection with the Liquidation Plan. On December 18, 2014, the EPA initiated an Administrative Complaint against HOVENSA for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act’s risk management program requirements at the St. Croix facility. In connection with the Liquidation Plan, HOVENSA has agreed to settle the EPA’s allegations with the payment of a civil penalty of $115,000. In February 2015, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) issued a notice of determination to terminate the HOVENSA pension plan. In connection with the HOVENSA’s sale to Limetree and the Liquidation Plan, the Corporation assumed the HOVENSA pension plan upon the effective date of the Liquidation Plan and the PBGC withdrew its notice of determination. In 2015, we recorded a charge of $30 million, primarily representing the estimated net difference between the HOVENSA pension plan obligation and fair value of the plan assets. On July 25, 2011, the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources commenced an enforcement action against HOVENSA by issuance of documents titled “Notice Of Violation, Order For Corrective Action, Notice Of Assessment of Civil Penalty, Notice Of Opportunity For Hearing” (the “NOVs”). The NOVs assert violations of Virgin Islands’ Air Pollution Control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on St. Croix in May 2011 and proposed total penalties of $210,000. We expect that any penalties arising from this matter will be covered by the liquidating trust established under the Liquidation Plan. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, such as those discussed above, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, the EPA’s claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these 18 proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. We are from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Hess Corporation is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and Norway. The Bakken Midstream operating segment, which was established in the second quarter of 2015, provides fee-based services, including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids, transportation of crude oil by rail car, terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids, and the storage and terminaling of propane, primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota. Transformation to a Pure Play E&P Company In 2013, we announced several initiatives to continue our transformation from an integrated energy company into a more geographically focused pure play E&P company. These initiatives represented the culmination of a multi-year strategic transformation designed to leverage our lean manufacturing capabilities across unconventional assets, exploit our deepwater drilling and project development capabilities, and execute a smaller, more targeted exploration program. This transformation was completed in 2015. During 2013 through 2015, the Corporation sold mature or lower margin E&P assets in Algeria, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom (UK) North Sea, and certain interests onshore in the U.S. In addition, the transformation plan included fully exiting the Corporation’s Marketing and Refining (M&R) business, including its terminal, retail, energy marketing and energy trading operations, as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its Port Reading, NJ facility. HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50/50 joint venture between the Corporation’s subsidiary, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), had previously shut down its U.S. Virgin Islands refinery in 2012. HOVENSA filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States District Court of the Virgin Islands in September 2015. In January 2016, Limetree Bay Terminals, LLC (Limetree) purchased the terminal and refinery assets of the St. Croix Facility and HOVENSA will conduct an orderly wind-down of its remaining activities. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Response to Low Oil Prices In 2015, we realized an adjusted net loss of $1,113 million and incurred a net operating cash flow deficit (cash flow from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities) of $2,225 million based on average 2015 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $48.80 per barrel (Brent - $53.64 per barrel). In response to the decline in crude oil prices that began in late 2014, we conducted an extensive company-wide review of our cost base and engaged with our suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce costs during 2015. As a result of these cost reduction efforts, we decreased E&P capital and exploratory expenditures by $400 million to $4.0 billion, and cash operating costs by approximately $300 million versus our 2015 plan. At December 31, 2015, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately $7.4 billion. Oil and gas production in 2016 is forecast to be in the range of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) compared with 375,000 boepd in 2015, and we have reduced our 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditure budget to approximately $2.4 billion, down 40% from 2015. Capital expenditures from our Bakken Midstream joint venture are expected to be approximately $340 million in 2016. Forward strip crude oil prices for 2016 are below average prices for 2015, and as a result, we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2016. In February 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of convertible preferred stock, for total net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion. We expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the full year of 2016 with cash on hand. Due to the low commodity price environment, we may take other steps to improve our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays, accessing other sources of liquidity by issuing debt and equity securities, and/or pursuing further asset sales. See Note 23, Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consolidated Results Net loss was $3,056 million in 2015 compared with net income in the prior two years (2014: $2,317 million; 2013: $5,052 million). Excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 28, adjusted net loss was $1,113 million in 2015 24 compared with adjusted net income in the prior two years (2014: $1,308 million; 2013: $1,892 million). Annual production averaged 375,000 boepd (2014: 329,000 boepd; 2013: 336,000 boepd) and is expected to average between 330,000 boepd and 350,000 boepd in 2016 excluding any contribution from Libya. Total proved reserves were 1,086 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), 1,431 million boe, and 1,437 million boe at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Lower crude oil prices in 2015 resulted in negative revisions of 234 million boe at December 31, 2015, primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves. Significant 2015 Activities The following is an update of significant E&P activities for 2015: Producing E&P assets: · In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged 112,000 boepd (2014: 83,000 boepd), with the increase from prior-year primarily due to ongoing field development. During 2015, we operated an average of 8.5 rigs, drilled 182 wells, completed 212 wells, and brought on production 219 wells, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,201 at December 31, 2015. Drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $5.8 million in 2015, down 21% from 2014. In 2016, we plan to operate an average of two rigs to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 wells on production while reducing capital expenditures to $425 million, down from $1.3 billion in 2015. Bakken production is forecast to average between 95,000 boepd and 105,000 boepd in 2016. · At the Valhall Field in Norway, net production averaged 33,000 boepd (2014: 31,000 boepd), with the increase from prior-year primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells in the current period. During 2015, the operator, BP, drilled one well and completed three wells, and continued to execute a multi-year well abandonment program. Production from the Valhall Field is forecast to average approximately 30,000 boepd in 2016, with the decrease from 2015 reflecting reduced drilling activity. · At Block A‑18 of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), the operator, Carigali Hess Operating Company, continued drilling production wells and progressed its booster compression project that is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2016. Production averaged 42,000 boepd (2014: 42,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia. Production from the JDA is forecast to average approximately 35,000 boepd in 2016 due to lower entitlement and downtime associated with the booster compression project. · At the Hess operated Tubular Bells Field, we achieved our first full year of production following first oil in late 2014. In the second half of 2015 a subsurface safety valve stuck in the closed position at one well and two other wells experienced wellbore skin effects that reduced production rates. As a result, full-year 2015 production from Tubular Bells was restricted to 19,000 boepd and we estimate full-year 2016 net production to be approximately 20,000 boepd to 25,000 boepd. In 2016, we intend to complete one water injector well, drill one production well, perform two wellbore stimulations, and complete a workover on a third well to open the stuck subsurface safety valve. · In the North Malay Basin (NMB), in 2015 net production from the Early Production System averaged approximately 40 million cubic feet per day (2014: 43 million cubic feet per day). In 2015, we also progressed fabrication and installation of the Central Processing Platform and commenced development drilling activities associated with the full-field development project. This project is on schedule to be completed in 2017, from which production is forecast to average approximately 165 million cubic feet per day. · At the South Arne Field, offshore Denmark, we continued drilling operations in 2015 and expect to complete drilling of a previously sanctioned eleven well multi-year program in the first quarter of 2016. Net production is forecast to average approximately between 10,000 boepd and 15,000 boepd in 2016 compared with 13,000 boepd in 2015. · In the Utica shale, 24 wells were drilled, 32 wells were completed and 32 wells were brought into production in 2015. Net production increased to approximately 24,000 boepd in 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of approximately 13,000 acres of Utica dry gas acreage for consideration of approximately $120 million. In 2016, we and our joint venture partner plan to suspend drilling activities, but will bring into production 14 wells. Net production is expected to average between 20,000 boepd and 25,000 boepd in 2016. · In Equatorial Guinea, we deferred the remaining portion of an infill drilling program at the Okume Field to reduce spend and allow time to evaluate recently acquired 4D seismic. Net production in 2016 is expected to average between 30,000 boepd and 35,000 boepd compared with net production in 2015 of 43,000 boepd. · In Algeria, production averaged 10,000 boepd for the fourth quarter of 2015. We sold our interests in the country on December 31, 2015. 25 · In Libya, civil and political unrest has largely interrupted production and crude oil export capability since August 2013. At the Waha fields (Hess 8%), the operator shut-in production for 2015 and force majeure declared by the national oil company of Libya remains in effect. Other E&P assets: · At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico, we expect to commence drilling of our first production well in the first quarter of 2016. Construction of production facilities and subsea equipment is underway with first production from the field targeted in 2018 at an expected net rate of 15,000 boepd. · In Ghana, we, along with our co-owners, continued development planning and subsurface evaluation in 2015. The government of Côte d’Ivoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of Ghana, which includes a portion of our Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license. We are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter, which may also impact our ability to develop the license. The International Tribunal for Law of the Sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017. Under terms of our license, the deadline to declare commerciality for the Pecan Field, which would be the primary development hub for the block, is in March 2016, and the deadline to submit a plan of development is in September 2016. We have requested an extension of the submission deadline for a plan of development for the Pecan Field, and will continue to work with the government on how best to progress work on the Block given the maritime border dispute. In 2015, we expensed previously capitalized gas wells that have not sufficiently progressed appraisal negotiations with the regulator. See Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs in Note 5, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. · At the Equus project on Block WA-390-P in the offshore Carnarvon Basin of Australia, in 2015 we initiated joint front-end engineering studies with a potential third-party liquefaction partner following the execution of a non-binding letter of intent with the same third-party liquefaction partner in 2014. In 2015, we commenced discussions with potential long-term purchasers of liquefied natural gas, and in 2016 we plan to drill a commitment well on Block WA-474-P which is adjacent to Block WA-390-P. We also wrote-off three previously capitalized wells that we determined will not be included in the current development concept. See Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs in Note 5, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. · In Guyana at the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, announced a significant oil discovery at the Liza-1 well in the second quarter of 2015. The operator plans to drill two appraisal wells, including one sidetrack with a production test, and two exploration wells in 2016. A new 17,000 square kilometer 3D seismic shoot is near completion and the operator, along with its partners, continues to evaluate the resource potential of the block. · At the Sicily prospect (Hess 25%), in the Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the operator successfully completed drilling and logging activities in 2015 of its initial exploration well. The discovery well was drilled to a depth of 30,214 feet and is being evaluated. Drilling of an appraisal well to further evaluate the discovery commenced in December 2015. · At the Melmar prospect in the Alaminos Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (Hess 35%), which we entered into during 2015, the operator, ConocoPhillips, commenced exploration drilling in December 2015. · In the Kurdistan region of Iraq (Hess 64%), we and our partner agreed to relinquish the Dinarta Block, and to exit operations in the region based on well results in 2015. The following is an update of significant Bakken Midstream activities during 2015: · We completed the sale of a 50% interest in our Bakken Midstream business to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion and formed a joint venture with GIP. The joint venture has filed a Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for an initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP limited partnership units to the public. The joint venture expects to initiate the offering when market conditions for the sale of limited partnership units become more favorable. · We commenced the construction of facilities and the reconfiguration of pipelines in McKenzie and Williams counties that are expected to increase throughput capacity for crude oil and natural gas originating from south of the Missouri River for transporting north to our natural gas processing and crude oil and natural gas liquids logistics assets in Tioga and Ramberg. We currently expect these projects to be fully in service in 2017. 26 Liquidity, and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,981 million in 2015 (2014: $4,457 million; 2013: $5,098 million). At December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were $2,716 million (2014: $2,444 million) and total debt was $6,630 million (2014: $5,987 million). Our debt to capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream operating segment, at December 31, 2015 was 24.4%. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 21.2% at December 31, 2014. Capital and exploratory expenditures from continuing operations were as follows: 2015 2014 2013 E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures United States Bakken $ 1,308 $ 1,854 $ 1,632 Other Onshore 332 725 830 Total Onshore 1,640 2,579 2,462 Offshore 923 765 865 Total United States 2,563 3,344 3,327 Europe 298 540 724 Africa 161 435 630 Asia and other 1,020 986 993 E&P - Capital and Exploratory Expenditures (a) $ 4,042 $ 5,305 $ 5,674 Exploration expenses charged to income included in E&P capital and exploratory expenditures above were: 2015 2014 2013 United States $ 132 $ 125 $ 192 International 157 207 250 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 289 $ 332 $ 442 (a) The above table excludes capital expenditures of $431 million and $106 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to our discontinued operations, and includes corporate capital expenditures of $53 million and $58 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. 2015 2014 2013 Bakken Midstream Capital Expenditures Bakken Midstream capital expenditures $ 296 $ 301 $ 535 We anticipate investing approximately $2.4 billion on E&P capital and exploratory expenditures in 2016 reflecting a planned reduction in our work program in response to the lower commodity price environment. Bakken Midstream capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $340 million in 2016. 27 Consolidated Results of Operations As described in Note 20, Segment Information, we established the Bakken Midstream operating segment in 2015 and have presented prior period numbers on a comparable basis.

The items in the table below are explained on pages 33 through 37. 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Exploration and Production $ (1,851 ) $ 542 $ 2,111 Bakken Midstream — — — Corporate, Interest and Other (44 ) (74 ) (26 ) Discontinued operations (48 ) 541 1,075 Total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods $ (1,943 ) $ 1,009 $ 3,160 In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after‑tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. The following table reconciles reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation and adjusted net income (loss): 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation $ (3,056 ) $ 2,317 $ 5,052 Less: Total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods (1,943 ) 1,009 3,160 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation $ (1,113 ) $ 1,308 $ 1,892 “Adjusted net income (loss)” presented in this report is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income (loss). 28 Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of our E&P operations: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Revenues and Non-operating Income Sales and other operating revenues $ 6,636 $ 10,737 $ 11,887 Gains on asset sales, net 31 817 2,171 Other, net (61 ) (46 ) (57 ) Total revenues and non-operating income 6,606 11,508 14,001 Costs and Expenses Cost of products sold (excluding items shown separately below) 1,409 1,826 1,786 Operating costs and expenses 1,764 1,815 1,996 Production and severance taxes 146 275 372 Bakken Midstream tariffs 449 212 — Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 881 840 1,031 General and administrative expenses 317 325 362 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3,852 3,140 2,638 Impairment 1,616 — 289 Total costs and expenses 10,434 8,433 8,474 Results of operations before income taxes (3,828 ) 3,075 5,527 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (1,111 ) 989 912 Net income (loss) (2,717 ) 2,086 4,615 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests — — 176 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation $ (2,717 ) $ 2,086 $ 4,439 Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 33, the changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, cost of products sold, cash operating costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, Bakken Midstream tariffs, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. 29 Selling Prices: Average realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 48% lower in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the declines in Brent and WTI crude oil prices that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, realized selling prices for natural gas liquids and natural gas declined by 66% and 31%, respectively, in 2015 compared to the prior year. In total, lower realized selling prices reduced 2015 financial results by approximately $2.5 billion after income taxes compared with 2014. Our average selling prices were as follows: 2015 2014 2013 Crude oil - per barrel (including hedging) United States Onshore $ 42.67 $ 81.89 $ 90.00 Offshore 46.21 95.05 103.83 Total United States 44.01 87.21 95.50 Europe 55.10 104.21 88.03 Africa 53.89 97.31 108.70 Asia 52.74 89.71 107.40 Worldwide 47.85 92.59 98.48 Crude oil - per barrel (excluding hedging) United States Onshore $ 41.22 $ 81.89 $ 89.81 Offshore 46.21 92.22 103.15 Total United States 43.11 86.06 95.11 Europe 52.37 99.20 87.45 Africa 51.57 93.70 108.07 Asia 52.74 89.71 107.40 Worldwide 46.37 90.20 98.01 Natural gas liquids - per barrel United States Onshore $ 9.18 $ 28.92 $ 43.14 Offshore 14.40 30.40 29.18 Total United States 10.02 29.32 38.07 Europe 24.59 52.66 58.31 Asia — — 74.94 Worldwide 10.52 30.59 40.68 Natural gas - per mcf United States Onshore $ 1.64 $ 3.18 $ 3.08 Offshore 2.03 3.79 2.83 Total United States 1.77 3.47 2.96 Europe 6.72 10.00 11.06 Asia and other 5.97 6.94 7.50 Worldwide 4.16 6.04 6.64 Crude oil price hedging contracts increased E&P Sales and other operating revenues by $126 million ($79 million after income taxes) in 2015, $193 million ($121 million after income taxes) in 2014 and $39 million ($25 million after income taxes) in 2013. No crude oil hedging contracts were open at December 31, 2015. 30 Production Volumes: Our net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2015 2014 2013 (In thousands) Operating Data Net Production Per Day Crude oil - barrels United States Bakken 81 66 55 Other Onshore 10 10 10 Total Onshore 91 76 65 Offshore 56 51 43 Total United States 147 127 108 Europe 38 36 44 Africa 51 54 62 Asia 2 3 11 Worldwide 238 220 225 Natural gas liquids - barrels United States Bakken 20 10 6 Other Onshore 12 7 4 Total Onshore 32 17 10 Offshore 6 6 5 Total United States 38 23 15 Europe 1 1 1 Asia — — 1 Worldwide 39 24 17 Natural gas - mcf United States Bakken 64 40 38 Other Onshore 109 47 25 Total Onshore 173 87 63 Offshore 87 78 61 Total United States 260 165 124 Europe 43 36 23 Asia and other 282 312 418 Worldwide 585 513 565 Barrels of oil equivalent (a) 375 329 336 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production 74 % 74 % 72 % (a) Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. In addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices on page 30. We expect total net production to average between 330,000 boepd and 350,000 boepd in 2016, excluding any contribution from Libya. Production variances related to 2015, 2014 and 2013 can be summarized as follows: United States: Onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to continued drilling in the Bakken oil shale play, while the increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to the Bakken and the Utica shale. Offshore production increased in 2015 relative to 2014 as higher production from the Tubular Bells Field, which came online in November 2014, was offset primarily by lower production from the Llano, Conger and Shenzi Fields. Crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2014 compared with 2013, a result of continued development of the Bakken oil shale play, higher production resulting from drilling in the Utica shale and a new production well combined with lower downtime at the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico. Europe: Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells at the Valhall Field in the current year. Crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the April 2013 sale of our Russian subsidiary, partially offset by higher production during 2014 at the 31 Valhall Field in Norway following completion of the redevelopment project in 2013. Higher natural gas production in 2014 compared to 2013 was a result of higher uptime from the Valhall Field. Africa: Crude oil production in Africa was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, due to Libyan production being shut-in. Crude oil production in Africa was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the shutdown of the Es Sider terminal in Libya in the third quarter of 2013, following civil unrest in the country. Net production averaged 4,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in 2014 and 13,000 bopd in 2013. In December 2014 the national oil company of Libya declared force majeure with respect to the Waha concession and production is currently shut-in. Asia and Other: Natural gas production was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to asset sales partially offset by higher production at the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA) as a result of higher facility uptime. Crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, as a result of the divestiture of our interests in the Pangkah Field in Indonesia in January 2014 and our interest in the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) fields, Azerbaijan in March 2013. Natural gas production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 following the divestiture of our remaining interests in Indonesia and Thailand in 2014 and lower production from the JDA, which was partially offset by a full year of production from the North Malay Basin. Sales Volumes: Our worldwide sales volumes were as follows: 2015 2014 2013 (In thousands) Crude oil - barrels 85,344 80,869 82,402 Natural gas liquids - barrels 14,400 8,793 6,244 Natural gas - mcf 213,195 187,381 206,122 Barrels of oil equivalent (a) 135,277 120,892 123,000 Crude oil - barrels per day 234 222 226 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day 39 24 17 Natural gas - mcf per day 584 513 565 Barrels of oil equivalent per day (a) 371 331 337 (a) Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. In addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. See the average selling prices on page 30. Cost of Products Sold: Cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third-parties, as well as rail transportation fees from our Bakken Midstream operating segment starting in 2014. The decrease in Cost of products sold in 2015 compared to 2014 principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices. Cost of products sold in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased volumes purchased from partners in our operated wells being offset by lower purchases from third-parties. Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of Operating costs and expenses, Production and severance taxes and E&P General and administrative expenses, decreased by $188 million in 2015 compared with the prior year (2014: $315 million decrease versus 2013). The decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to cost reductions across the portfolio and lower production taxes in the Bakken, which were partially offset by higher operating costs at Tubular Bells where production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects lower production taxes and operating costs following the divestitures of our remaining Indonesia and Thailand assets in early 2014 and our interests in Russia in April 2013, as well as lower employee costs. Bakken Midstream Tariffs: Tariffs for 2015 primarily reflect higher volumes processed through the Tioga gas plant which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 to complete a plant expansion and refurbishment project. The tariff arrangements were not in place prior to 2014. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) costs increased by $712 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily reflecting higher production volumes from the Bakken, Tubular Bells and Utica fields, which had higher DD&A rates per barrel than the portfolio average. Higher production in 2014 from these fields, as well as the Valhall Field and North Malay Basin, were the primarily drivers for the increase in DD&A costs in 2014 compared to 2013. 32 Unit costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P production volumes and exclude items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: Actual Forecast 2015 2014 2013 2016 (a) Cash operating costs $ 15.69 $ 20.01 $ 21.52 $14.50 — $15.50 Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs 28.14 26.10 21.35 28.50 — 29.50 Total production unit costs $ 43.83 $ 46.11 $ 42.87 $ 43.00 — $45.00 Bakken Midstream tariffs expense (b) $ 3.28 $ 1.77 $ — $3.55 — $3.95 (a) Forecasted amounts assume no contribution from Libya. (b) Bakken Midstream tariff arrangements were not in place prior to 2014. In 2013, Bakken Midstream earned revenues at the Tioga gas plant by purchasing unprocessed natural gas from our E&P business and third-parties, processing those hydrocarbons and selling them back to our E&P business or third-party customers based on a percentage of proceeds. Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. For 2016, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $260 million to $280 million. Income Taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations amounted to a benefit of 46% in 2015 (2014: 41% charge; 2013: 42% charge). The tax benefit in 2015 resulted from operating losses, while the increased effective rate from 2014 is due to a greater proportion of results attributable to higher tax jurisdictions. The decline in the effective tax rate from 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to the impact of shut‑in production in Libya from the third quarter of 2013. Based on current strip crude oil prices, we are forecasting a pre-tax loss for 2016 and, as a result, the E&P effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 41% to 45% excluding Libyan operations. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Impairment $ (1,616 ) $ — $ (289 ) $ (1,566 ) $ — $ (187 ) Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses (518 ) (304 ) (298 ) (301 ) (173 ) (186 ) Exit costs and other (44 ) (28 ) (129 ) (37 ) (11 ) (117 ) Inventory write-off (87 ) — — (58 ) — — Gain on asset sales, net 28 801 2,195 10 774 2,145 Noncontrolling interest share of gain on asset sale — — (168 ) — — (168 ) Income taxes — — — 101 (48 ) 624 $ (2,237 ) $ 469 $ 1,311 $ (1,851 ) $ 542 $ 2,111 The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) are presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income as follows: Before Income Taxes 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Gains on asset sales, net $ 28 $ 801 $ 2,195 Other, net (14 ) — (8 ) Cost of products sold (excluding items shown separately below) (39 ) (18 ) — Operating costs and expenses (51 ) — (22 ) Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment (518 ) (304 ) (317 ) General and administrative expenses (27 ) (10 ) (64 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization — — (16 ) Impairment (1,616 ) — (289 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — — (168 ) $ (2,237 ) $ 469 $ 1,311 33 Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods were as follows: 2015: · Impairment: We recorded noncash goodwill impairment charges totaling $1,483 million pre-tax ($1,483 million after income taxes), representing all goodwill of our E&P segment, due to the decline in crude oil prices. See Note 6, Goodwill in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $133 million ($83 million after income taxes) associated with our legacy conventional North Dakota assets. · Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recognized a pre-tax charge of $190 million ($86 million after income taxes) to write-off an exploration well, associated leasehold expenses and other costs related to the Dinarta Block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq following the decision of the Corporation and its partner to relinquish the block and exit operations in the region. In offshore Ghana, we expensed previously capitalized well costs of $182 million ($117 million after income taxes) primarily associated with natural gas discoveries that have not sufficiently progressed appraisal negotiations with the regulator. In offshore Australia, we expensed previously capitalized well costs of $62 million ($45 million after income taxes) associated with discovered resources that we determined will not be included in the current development concept for the Equus project. In addition, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $84 million ($53 million after income taxes) primarily to impair exploration leases in the Gulf of Mexico. · Exit costs and other: We recognized pre-tax charges totaling $21 million ($21 million after income taxes) associated with terminated international office space and incurred charges of $23 million ($16 million after income taxes) related to employee severance and other expenses. · Inventory write-off: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $48 million ($30 million after income taxes) to write off surplus drilling materials based on future drilling plans and recognized a pre-tax charge of $39 million ($28 million after income taxes) to reduce crude oil inventories to their net realizable value. · Gain on asset sales, net: We completed the sale of approximately 13,000 acres of Utica dry gas acreage for consideration of approximately $120 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $49 million ($31 million after income taxes). We also completed the sale of our producing assets in Algeria in December 2015 and recognized a pre-tax loss of $21 million ($21 million after income taxes). · Income taxes: In 2015, we recorded net tax benefits totaling $101 million, comprised of $154 million to recognize a deferred tax benefit from a legal entity restructuring, $50 million benefit from receiving approval for an international investment incentive, a $9 million benefit from remeasuring deferred taxes for a change in the Norwegian enacted tax rates, and a $112 million charge to recognize a partial valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets. 2014: · Gain on asset sales, net: We completed the sale of our producing assets in Thailand, 77,000 net acres of Utica dry gas acreage, including related wells and facilities, and an exploration asset in the United Kingdom North Sea. These divestitures generated total cash proceeds of $1,933 million and total pre-tax gains of $801 million ($774 million after income taxes). At the time of sale, these assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 19,000 boepd. · Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded dry hole and other exploration expenses for the write-off of a previously capitalized exploration well in the western half of Block 469 in the Gulf of Mexico of $169 million ($105 million after income taxes) and other charges totaling $135 million pre-tax ($68 million after income taxes) to write-off leasehold acreage in the Paris Basin of France, the Shakrok Block in Kurdistan and our interest in a natural gas exploration project, offshore Sabah, Malaysia. · Exit costs and other: We recorded pre-tax severance and other exit costs of $28 million ($11 million after income taxes) resulting from our transformation to a more focused pure play E&P company. · Income taxes: We recorded an income tax charge of $48 million for remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from legal entity restructurings. 2013: · Gain on asset sales, net: We completed the sale of the Natuna A Field in Indonesia, the Samara-Nafta Field in Russia, the Beryl Field in the United Kingdom and the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli Field in Azerbaijan. Before allowing 34 for the share of noncontrolling interests, these divestitures generated total cash proceeds of $4,099 million and total pre-tax gains of $2,195 million ($2,145 million after income taxes). At the time of sale, these assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 72,000 boepd. · Noncontrolling interest share of gain on asset sale: The gain arising from the sale of Samara-Nafta was reduced by $168 million for the noncontrolling interest holder’s share of the gain. · Impairment: We incurred impairment charges of $289 million ($187 million after income taxes) related to the Pangkah Field to adjust its carrying value to its fair value at December 31, 2013. · Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded dry hole costs of $260 million ($163 million after income taxes) associated with the write-off of two previously drilled discovery wells in Area 54, offshore Libya due to continued civil unrest in the country and we recognized a charge of $38 million ($23 million after income taxes) to write-off certain onshore leasehold acreage in the U.S. · Exit costs and other: We recorded net pre-tax charges of $129 million ($117 million after income taxes) for severance, non-cash charges associated with the cessation of use of certain leased office space and other exit costs, resulting from our planned divestitures and transformation into a more focused pure play E&P company. · Income taxes: In December 2013, the country of Denmark enacted a new hydrocarbon income tax law that resulted in a combination of changes to tax rates, revisions to the amount of uplift allowed on capital expenditures and special transition rules. As a consequence of the tax law change, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $674 million. In addition we recorded non-cash income tax charges totaling $50 million related to a planned asset divestiture and the repatriation of foreign earnings. Bakken Midstream Net income (loss) of our Bakken Midstream operating segment, which is primarily located in North Dakota, is summarized as follows: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Revenues and Non-operating Income Total revenues and non-operating income $ 564 $ 319 $ 270 Costs and Expenses Cost of products sold (excluding items shown separately below) — — 190 Operating costs and expenses 265 219 249 General and administrative expenses 14 11 15 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 88 70 33 Interest expense 10 2 — Total costs and expenses 377 302 487 Results of operations before income taxes 187 17 (217 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 52 7 (81 ) Net income (loss) 135 10 (136 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 49 — — Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation $ 86 $ 10 $ (136 ) Total revenues and non-operating income in 2015 improved from 2014 mainly due to higher throughput volumes at the Tioga gas plant. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Tioga gas plant was shut down for a large‑scale expansion, refurbishment and optimization project, during which a new cryogenic processing train was installed and processing capacity was increased to 250 mmcfd from 120 mmcfd. The Tioga gas plant’s expanded operations commenced in late March 2014. Total revenues and non-operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 as a result of tariff arrangements becoming effective in 2014. These arrangements allow for Bakken Midstream operating segment to charge a fee based tariff to Exploration and Production for certain Midstream services provided. Prior to 2014, when providing natural gas processing services, our Bakken Midstream operating segment purchased unprocessed natural gas and provided processing services pursuant to percentage-of-proceeds contracts whereby it retained a portion of the sales proceeds received from both our E&P operating segment and third-party customers. Pursuant to these contracts, the Bakken Midstream operating segment also charged certain additional fees. The remaining proceeds were remitted back to suppliers. In addition, total revenues and non-operating income for 2014 also 35 benefited from the large‑scale expansion, refurbishment and optimization project at the Tioga gas plant which resulted in a shut-down of the plant from November 2013 to March 2014. Operating costs and expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to an increase in third‑party operating and maintenance expense. Operating costs and expenses were lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a reduction in activity following the shutdown of the Tioga gas plant between November 2013 and March 2014. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses were higher in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to a full year’s usage of the Tioga gas plant in 2015. DD&A expenses were higher in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the commencement of depreciation of the Tioga gas plant expansion expenditures upon restart of operations in late March 2014. For 2016, we estimate Net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Bakken Midstream segment, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million. Corporate, Interest and Other The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 219 $ 217 $ 263 Interest expense 376 397 466 Less: Capitalized interest (45 ) (76 ) (60 ) Interest expense, net 331 321 406 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes 550 538 669 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (217 ) (208 ) (252 ) Net Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes 333 330 417 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after-tax 44 74 26 Total Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes $ 377 $ 404 $ 443 Corporate and other expenses for 2014 include a pre-tax gain of $13 million ($8 million after income taxes) related to the disposition of our 50% interest in a joint venture involved in the construction of an electric generating facility in Newark, New Jersey. Excluding the gain, 2015 costs are down compared to 2014 primarily due to lower employee costs and other expenses. Corporate expenses were lower in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting lower employee related costs, contract labor and professional fees. In 2016 after-tax corporate expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. Interest expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, as lower interest rates offset higher average borrowings. Capitalized interest was also lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on the Tubular Bells Field upon first production in the fourth quarter of 2014. Interest expense, net was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting lower average outstanding debt, lower letter of credit fees and higher capitalized interest. In 2016 after-tax interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: In 2015 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $76 million ($49 million after income taxes) associated with debtor-in-possession financing provided to HOVENSA LLC and the estimated liability resulting from its bankruptcy resolution. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. In 2015, we also incurred exit costs of $6 million ($4 million after income taxes) and recorded a pre-tax gain of $20 million ($13 million after income taxes) from the sale of land. In 2014 we recorded pre-tax charges of $84 million ($52 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of our investment in the Bayonne Energy Center to fair value, $19 million ($12 million after income taxes) for net pre‑tax severance charges and $15 million ($10 million after income taxes) for exit related costs. In 2013 we recorded pre‑tax charges of $21 million ($13 million after income taxes) for severance charges related to our transformation into a pure play E&P company and $19 million ($13 million after income taxes) for exit related costs, including costs for cessation of leased office space. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations attributable to Hess Corporation were a net loss of $48 million in 2015 compared to net income of $625 million in 2014 and $1,192 million in 2013. Discontinued operations included ownership of an energy trading partnership through February 2015, retail marketing through September 2014, terminals through December 2013, energy marketing through November 2013 and Port Reading refining activities through the date it was permanently shut down in February 2013. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: In September 2014, we completed the sale of our retail business for cash proceeds of approximately $2.8 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $954 million ($602 36 million after income taxes). During 2014, we recorded pre-tax gains of $275 million ($171 million after income taxes) relating to the liquidation of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventories associated with the divested downstream operations. In addition, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $308 million ($202 million after income taxes) in 2014 for impairments, environmental matters, severance and exit related activities associated with the divestiture of downstream operations. We also recognized in 2014 a pre-tax charge of $115 million ($72 million after income taxes) related to the termination of lease contracts and the purchase of 180 retail gasoline stations in preparation for the sale of the retail operations. In January 2014, we acquired our partners’ 56% interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline joint venture, for approximately $290 million and the settlement of liabilities. In connection with this business combination, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $39 million ($24 million after income taxes) to remeasure the carrying value of our original 44% equity interest in WilcoHess to fair value. The assets and liabilities acquired from WilcoHess were included in the sale of the retail business in September 2014. In December 2013, we sold our U.S. East Coast terminal network, St. Lucia terminal and related businesses for cash proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $739 million ($531 million after income taxes). In November 2013, we sold our energy marketing business for cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $761 million ($464 million after income taxes). In addition, we recognized pre-tax gains of $678 million ($414 million after income taxes) relating to the liquidation of LIFO inventories as a result of ceasing refining operations and the sales of our energy marketing and terminals businesses. During 2013, we also incurred $131 million ($80 million after income taxes) of net employee severance charges and $230 million ($154 million after income taxes) of other exit costs, including environmental, legal and professional fees. As a result of the permanent shutdown of the Port Reading refining facility, we recorded charges of $82 million ($49 million after income taxes) for shutdown related costs and $80 million ($51 million after income taxes) for asset impairments. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: December 31, December 31, 2015 2014 (In millions, except ratio) Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,716 $ 2,444 Current maturities of long-term debt 86 68 Total debt (a) 6,630 5,987 Total equity 20,401 22,320 Debt to capitalization ratio (b) 24.5 % 21.2 % (a) Includes $710 million of debt outstanding from our Bakken Midstream joint venture at December 31, 2015. (b) Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. 37 Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Cash flows from operating activities: Cash provided by (used in) operating activities - continuing operations $ 2,016 $ 4,504 $ 3,936 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities - discontinued operations (35 ) (47 ) 1,162 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 1,981 4,457 5,098 Cash flows from investing activities: Additions to property, plant and equipment - E&P (3,956 ) (4,867 ) (5,413 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment - Bakken Midstream (365 ) (347 ) (524 ) Proceeds from asset sales 50 2,978 4,458 Other, net (44 ) (192 ) (285 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations (4,315 ) (2,428 ) (1,764 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities - discontinued operations 109 2,436 2,114 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (4,206 ) 8 350 Cash flows from financing activities: Cash provided by (used in) financing activities - continuing operations 2,497 (3,828 ) (4,266 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities - discontinued operations — (7 ) (10 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 2,497 (3,835 ) (4,276 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations 198 (1,752 ) (2,094 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from discontinued operations 74 2,382 3,266 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 272 $ 630 $ 1,172 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities declined to $1,981 million in 2015 (2014: $4,457 million), primarily reflecting the decline in benchmark crude oil prices. Net cash provided by operating activities declined to $4,457 million in 2014 (2013: $5,098 million), reflecting the impact of changes in working capital, lower operating earnings primarily as a result of asset sales, and the decline in benchmark crude oil prices. Investing Activities: The decrease in Additions to property, plant and equipment in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily due to reduced drilling activity (the Bakken, the Utica, Norway and Equatorial Guinea), reduced development expenditures at Tubular Bells and the JDA, and lower exploratory drilling activity (Ghana and Kurdistan). These reductions were offset by 2015 activity related to development activities at Stampede in the Gulf of Mexico and exploration drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Guyana, and full field development at North Malay Basin. The decrease in Additions to property, plant and equipment in 2014, as compared with 2013, is largely due to the ongoing reduction in capital expenditures in the Bakken, reflecting lower well costs, and completion of the Tioga gas plant expansion project. Total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to $50 million in 2015 (2014: $2,978 million; 2013: $4,458 million). In 2014, we completed asset sales of our dry gas acreage in the Utica shale play, our assets in Thailand, the Pangkah Field, offshore Indonesia, and our interests in two power plant joint ventures. Completed sales in 2013 included our interests in the Beryl, ACG, Eagle Ford and Natuna A fields, and our Russian subsidiary, Samara-Nafta. In 2014, net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations included proceeds of $2.8 billion from the sale of the retail business. In addition, we acquired in January 2014, our partners’ 56% interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline joint venture, for approximately $290 million. In June 2014, we incurred capital expenditures of $105 million related to the acquisition of previously leased retail gasoline stations. Both of these transactions were undertaken in connection with our divestiture of our retail business. Net cash provided by investing activities related to discontinued operations for 2013 includes proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion from the sales of our energy marketing operations and our U.S. East Coast terminal network, St. Lucia terminal and related businesses. Financing Activities: During 2015, we received net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion from the sale of a 50% interest in our Bakken Midstream business. Upon formation of the joint venture, HIP issued $600 million of debt under a Term Loan A facility. The proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners. During 2014, we issued $600 million ($598 million net of discount) of unsecured, fixed rate notes and repaid $590 million of debt, including $250 million of unsecured, fixed rate notes, $74 million assumed in the acquisition of WilcoHess, and $249 million for the payment of various lease obligations primarily related to the retirement of our retail gasoline station leases. In 2013, we repaid $2,348 million, net under available credit facilities and repaid $136 million of other debt. The net repayments under the 38 credit facilities consisted of $990 million on our short‑term credit facilities, $758 million on our syndicated revolving credit facility and $600 million on our asset backed credit facility. In 2015, we paid $142 million for the purchase and settlement of common shares under our $6.5 billion Board authorized stock repurchase plan (2014: $3,715 million; 2013: $1,493 million). Total common stock dividends paid were $287 million in 2015 (2014: $303 million; 2013: $235 million). We received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $12 million in 2015 (2014: $182 million; 2013: $128 million). Future Capital Requirements and Resources At December 31, 2015, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including $0.4 billion held outside of the U.S. which we have the ability to repatriate without triggering a U.S. cash tax liability, and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately $7.4 billion. Oil and gas production in 2016 is forecast to be in the range of 330,000 to 350,000 boepd compared with 375,000 boepd in 2015, and we have reduced our 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditure budget to approximately $2.4 billion, down 40% from 2015. Capital expenditures from our Bakken Midstream joint venture are expected to be approximately $340 million in 2016. Forward strip crude oil prices for 2016 are below average prices for 2015, and as a result, we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2016. In February 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of convertible preferred stock, for total net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion. We expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the full year of 2016 with cash on hand. Due to the low commodity price environment, we may take other steps to improve our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays, accessing other sources of liquidity by issuing debt and equity securities, and/or pursuing further asset sales. See Note 23, Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2015: Letters of Expiration Credit Available Date Capacity Borrowings Issued Total Used Capacity (In millions) Revolving credit facility - Hess Corporation January 2020 $ 4,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,000 Revolving credit facility - Bakken Midstream (a) July 2020 400 110 — 110 290 Committed lines Various (b) 650 — 10 10 640 Uncommitted lines Various (b) 103 — 103 103 — Total $ 5,153 $ 110 $ 113 $ 223 $ 4,930 (a) The Revolving credit facility – Bakken Midstream may only be utilized by Hess Infrastructure Partners. (b) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2016. We had $113 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2015 (2014: $397 million), which in 2015 primarily relate to our international operations. See also Note 22, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2015, we entered into a $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that expires in January 2020. The new facility, which replaced a $4 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in April 2016, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Based on our credit rating as of December 31, 2015, borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.075% above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A fee of 0.175% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate and facility fee will be higher if our credit rating is lowered. Our long-term debt agreements, including the revolving credit facilities, contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. The most restrictive of these covenants allow us to borrow up to an additional $5,495 million of secured debt at December 31, 2015. In July 2015, HIP, a 50/50 joint venture between us and GIP, incurred $600 million of debt through a 5-year Term Loan A facility. The proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners. HIP also entered into a $400 million 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility, which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit and is expected to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures. Borrowings on both loan facilities generally bear interest at the LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.10% to 2.00%. Facility fees on the revolving credit facility accrue at an applicable rate every quarter, ranging from 0.15% to 0.35% per annum. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on the joint venture’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). If the joint venture obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The joint venture’s credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally 39 require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as EBITDA to interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. At December 31, 2015, borrowings attributable to the joint venture, which are non-recourse to Hess Corporation, amounted to $600 million on the Term Loan A loan facility and $110 million on the revolving credit facility. HIP is in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2015, and its financial covenants do not currently impact their ability to issue indebtedness to fund future capital expenditures. We also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Credit Ratings Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. In January 2016, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed our BBB credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative. In February 2016, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered our credit rating to Ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade. The consequence of lower credit ratings is to increase interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities. In addition, we have contractual requirements to provide collateral to certain counterparties when one rating agency rates our unsecured debt below investment grade. Due to the recent rating change by Moody’s we may be required to issue collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately $200 million. Certain other contracts require we provide collateral when two of three rating agencies rate us below investment grade. If Fitch or S&P were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade, we estimate that we could be required to issue letters of credit up to an additional $200 million as of December 31, 2015. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2015: Payments Due by Period 2017 and 2019 and Total 2016 2018 2020 Thereafter (In millions) Total debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 6,630 $ 86 $ 535 $ 1,681 $ 4,328 Operating leases 2,445 674 925 473 373 Purchase obligations: Capital expenditures 1,750 1,503 247 — — Operating expenses 548 384 108 32 24 Transportation and related contracts 1,598 121 453 433 591 Asset retirement obligations 2,383 225 608 307 1,243 Other liabilities 1,160 66 120 123 851 (a) We anticipate cash payments for interest of $391 million for 2016, $789 million for 2017-2018, $644 million for 2019-2020, and $3,988 million thereafter for a total of $5,812 million. Capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at December 31, 2015, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2016. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other long‑term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, lease drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2015, we have $32 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable. See also Note 19, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations We conduct exploration and production activities outside the U.S., principally in Europe (Norway and Denmark), Africa (Equatorial Guinea, Libya, and Ghana) and Asia and Other (Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand, Malaysia, 40 Australia, Guyana and Canada). Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, corruption, acts of terrorism, tax law changes and currency risk. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year. Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. For example, the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $50.13 and $94.42 per barrel, respectively. The drop in prices for 2015 resulted in negative revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2015 of 234 million barrels of oil equivalent, primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves. At December 31, 2015, spot prices for WTI crude oil closed at $37.13 per barrel and averaged $31.78 per barrel in January 2016. If crude oil prices in 2016 stay at levels below that used in determining 2015 proved reserves, we may recognize further negative revisions up to a significant majority of our December 31, 2015 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2016 above those used in determining 2015 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2016. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2016 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2016 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 would result in an approximate $350 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2016. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 85 through 89 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves. Bakken Midstream Joint Venture: On July 1, 2015 we sold a 50% interest in Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP) to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion. We consolidate the activities of 41 HIP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered HIP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between HIP and us, and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of HIP. Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. Our impairment tests of long‑lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. We could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. As a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices, we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment. See Note 10, Impairment in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1 or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. Prior to the second quarter of 2015, we had one operating segment, E&P consisting of two reporting units, Offshore and Onshore which reflected the manner in which performance was assessed by the Operating segment manager. In the second quarter of 2015 we established a second operating segment, Bakken Midstream, which previously was part of the Onshore reporting unit. Prior to the formation of the Bakken Midstream operating segment the Offshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $1,098 million while the Onshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $760 million. Upon formation of the Bakken Midstream operating segment, we allocated $375 million of goodwill from the Onshore reporting unit to the Bakken Midstream operating segment based on the relative fair values of the Bakken Midstream business and the remainder of the Onshore reporting unit. There was no change to the composition of the Offshore reporting unit. In step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination. The resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded. Our fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control and increased market share. The determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. We also consider the relative market valuation of similar peer companies, and other market data if available, in determining fair value of a reporting unit. In addition, a qualitative reconciliation of our 42 market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two. If a reporting unit fails step one, it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value. As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset. In the second quarter of 2015, we performed impairment tests on the Offshore and Onshore reporting units in accordance with accounting standards for goodwill immediately prior to creation of the Bakken Midstream operating segment. No impairment resulted from this assessment. In addition, accounting standards require that following a reorganization, allocated goodwill should be tested for impairment. We also performed impairment tests on the allocated goodwill for the Bakken Midstream and the Onshore reporting unit at June 30, 2015. Goodwill allocated to the Bakken Midstream operating segment passed the impairment test but the goodwill allocated to the Onshore reporting unit did not pass the impairment test. As a result, we recorded a noncash pre-tax charge of $385 million ($385 million after income taxes) in the second quarter of 2015 to reflect the Onshore reporting unit’s goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards. As a result of the decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an impairment test at December 31, 2015 on the Offshore reporting unit and determined its goodwill was impaired. We recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1,098 million ($1,098 million after income taxes) to reflect the Offshore reporting unit’s goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards. We expect that the benefits of our remaining goodwill totaling $375 million will be recovered through the Bakken Midstream operating segment based on market conditions at December 31, 2015. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. We have net deferred tax assets of $2,653 million recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the reversal of temporary differences, the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with our internal business forecasts. Additional valuation allowances may be required if internal business forecasts adopt lower selling price assumptions or development plans. We do not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. In order to measure these obligations, we estimate the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. 43 Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long‑term rates of return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels, and participant mortality assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements. Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Environment, Health and Safety Our long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. 44 We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. We are committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions mandates and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities, sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2015, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $13 million in 2015 (2014: $12 million; 2013: $16 million). The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As discussed in Note 22, Financial Risk Management Activities, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. We were exposed to commodity price risks primarily related to crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as foreign currency values, from our 50% voting interest in a consolidated energy trading joint venture, HETCO, which was sold in the first quarter of 2015. Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Controls include volumetric and term limits. Our treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them: ● Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third-parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. ● Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound and Danish Krone which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. ● Exchange Traded Contracts: We use exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. ● Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and have the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. Financial Risk Management Activities Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by us or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we do business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed‑rate interest payments to floating. We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $95 million at December 31, 2015. 45 At December 31, 2015, our outstanding long‑term debt of $6,630 million, including current maturities, had a fair value of $6,515 million. A 15% increase or decrease in the rate of interest would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately $410 million or $480 million, respectively. Trading Activities In February 2015, we sold our interest in our energy trading joint venture, HETCO, which was subsequently renamed Hartree Partners, LP (Hartree). Pursuant to the terms of the sale, Hartree was permitted to utilize our guarantees issued in favor of Hartree's existing counterparties until November 12, 2015, provided that new trades were for a period of one year or less, complied with certain credit requirements, and net exposures remained within value at risk limits previously applied by us. The guarantees remain in effect until the qualifying trades outstanding at November 12, 2015 mature. We have the right to seek reimbursement from Hartree and a separate Hartree credit support facility upon any counterparty draw on the applicable guarantee from us. No draws on the guaranteed trades have occurred through December 31, 2015. A liability of $10 million associated with the guarantee is included in other accrued liabilities at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2014, HETCO assets totaling $1,035 million, consisting of accounts receivable and other long-lived assets, were reported in Other current assets, and liabilities totaling $797 million, which consisted primarily of accounts payable, were reported in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 46 Item 8.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chief Executive Officer February 25, 2016 48 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries, and our report dated February 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York February 25, 2016 49 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.

Risk Factors Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below. These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, liquidity, financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, and our associated realized price differentials, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of OPEC, may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets. Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions, the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally. The sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Average prices for 2016 were $43.47 per barrel for WTI (2015: $48.76; 2014: $92.91) and $45.13 per barrel for Brent (2015: $53.60; 2014: $99.45). In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain significant bank credit facilities. An inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Similar risks, however, may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement, replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices, such as those currently prevailing, may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. Crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016 resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2017 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2016, it could have an adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the value of our business. See Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. 15 Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. For example, in 2016, we had a significant net loss and, if commodity prices remain low through 2017, we are forecasting a net loss for 2017. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. In February 2016, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered our credit rating to Ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade. In December 2016, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook. In February 2017, S&P re-affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BBB- with stable outlook. Although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, further ratings downgrades, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, further ratings downgrades may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, geographic territorial border disputes, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political and civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is used to produce petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our 16 sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‑made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, such as the third-party accident at the Macondo prospect, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‑attacks. Although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures. This may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows. Departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. The derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management. Moreover, an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, with a commensurate impact on shareholder value. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. An inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost. These consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. We manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility. Cyber‑attacks targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners. Cyber‑attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A cyber‑attack against these operating systems, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, a cyber-attack could have a material adverse impact on 17 our cash flows and results of operations. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition, as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state, have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been removed to Federal court and has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. The suit filed in Vermont is proceeding there in a state court. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit in Federal court alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. An action brought by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was settled in conjunction with the Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation of HOVENSA’s Liquidation Plan, which is described below. The remaining open matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and also agreed with EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. In April 2014, the EPA issued a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) proposing to conduct bank-to-bank dredging of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because there are numerous other parties who we expect will share in the cost of remediation and damages and our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length. In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. The remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. EPA has estimated that this remedy will cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal adjacent to the Canal. We indicated to EPA that we would comply with the Administrative Order and are currently contributing funding for the Remedial Design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties. At the same time, we are participating in an allocation process whereby neutral experts selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the Remedial Design costs to be paid by each of the participants. The parties have not yet addressed the allocation of costs associated with implementing the remedy that is currently being designed. This matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 18 On January 18, 2017, we entered into a Consent Decree with the North Dakota Department of Health resolving alleged non-compliance with North Dakota’s air pollution laws and provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Pursuant to the Consent Decree, we are required to implement corrective actions, including implementation of a leak detection and repair program, at most of our existing facilities in North Dakota. We were assessed a base penalty of $922,000, which is subject to adjustment based on the date we complete corrective actions required under the terms of the Consent Decree. We made an initial penalty payment of $55,000 during the first quarter of 2017. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, such as those discussed above, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, the EPA’s claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. We are from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Hess Corporation is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), Malaysia, and Norway. The Bakken Midstream operating segment, which was established in the second quarter of 2015, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids, or NGLs; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; and storing and terminaling propane, primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. Response to Low Oil Prices In 2016 our industry continued to face a challenging commodity price environment leading to further reductions in capital investment compared with 2015. Our realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were $39.20 per barrel in 2016 (2015: $47.85; 2014: $92.59). In response, we improved operating efficiency across our portfolio and reduced our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures during 2016 to $1.9 billion, a decrease of over 50% compared to the same period in 2015, which partially contributed to our lower 2016 oil and gas production levels. In addition to improving our operating efficiency and reducing our capital and exploratory expenditures, we proactively took other steps in 2016 to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and improve liquidity, including issuing equity securities and executing a debt refinancing transaction. In February 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, for total net proceeds of $1.6 billion. In the third quarter of 2016, we initiated a debt refinancing transaction by issuing $1 billion of 4.30% notes due in 2027 and $500 million of 5.80% notes due in 2047 with proceeds used primarily to purchase higher-coupon bonds and redeem near-term maturities. At December 31, 2016, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately $7.3 billion. We project our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.25 billion in 2017 as we plan to increase from two rigs to six rigs in the Bakken over the course of 2017. Capital expenditures for our Midstream operations are expected to be approximately $190 million. Oil and gas production in 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 300,000 boepd to 310,000 boepd excluding any contribution from Libya. As a result of reduced capital expenditures in 2016 and a high level of planned maintenance in the second quarter of 2017, we forecast our production to decline during the first half of 2017 and then increase in the third and fourth quarters of the year with the start-up of North Malay Basin and a new well at the Penn State Field in the Gulf of Mexico expected in the third quarter and production increases as a result of the rig ramp up in the Bakken. In 2016, we realized a net operating cash flow deficit (cash flow from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities) of $1,295 million. Forward strip crude oil prices for 2017 are higher than average prices for 2016, and as a result, we forecast a smaller net operating cash flow deficit in 2017. We expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the full year of 2017 with cash on hand. Due to the low commodity price environment, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce our planned capital program and other cash outlays, borrow from our committed credit facilities, issue debt or equity securities, and pursue asset sales. Consolidated Results Net loss attributable to Hess Corporation was $6,132 million in 2016 and $3,056 million in 2015. In 2014, net income attributable to Hess Corporation was $2,317 million. Excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 27, the adjusted net loss was $1,489 million in 2016 and $1,113 million in 2015. Adjusted net income in 2014 was $1,308 million. Annual production averaged 322,000 boepd in 2016, 375,000 boepd in 2015, and 329,000 boepd in 2014. Total proved reserves were 1,109 million boe, 1,086 million boe, and 1,431 million boe at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Lower crude oil prices in 2015 resulted in negative revisions of 234 million boe at December 31, 2015, primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves. 23 Significant 2016 Activities The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2016: Producing E&P assets: • In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged 105,000 boepd (2015: 112,000 boepd), with the decrease from the prior-year period primarily due to reduced drilling activity in response to low oil prices. During 2016, we operated an average of 3.3 rigs, drilled 71 wells, completed 92 wells, and brought on production 100 wells, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,272 at December 31, 2016. Drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $4.8 million in 2016, down 17% from 2015. In 2016, we also increased our standard well design to a 50-stage completion from the previous 35-stage completion. During 2017, we plan to increase our rig count to six rigs from two rigs, for an average of 3.5 rigs, to drill approximately 80 wells and bring approximately 75 wells on production. Net production for full year 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 95,000 boepd and 105,000 boepd. With the building rig count we expect our Bakken production in the fourth quarter of 2017 to average between 105,000 boepd and 110,000 boepd, which would represent a growth rate of approximately 15% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. • In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 boepd (2015: 77,000 boepd). The decrease in production was the result of unplanned well downtime at the Tubular Bells Field (Hess 57%) due to subsurface valve failures in three wells, unplanned downtime at the Conger Field (Hess 38%) due to a failed subsurface valve in one well, and natural decline. Well workovers were conducted to replace the subsurface valves in the three wells at the Tubular Bells Field and in the well at the Conger Field, which caused an increase in workover expense for the year. In addition, we brought online a fifth production well and one water injection well at Tubular Bells during the year. In 2017, Gulf of Mexico production is forecast to average approximately 65,000 boepd. • At the Valhall Field offshore Norway, net production averaged 28,000 boepd (2015: 33,000 boepd), with the decrease from the prior year primarily due to lower drilling activity, natural field decline and a planned shutdown. Net production from the Valhall Field is forecast to average between 25,000 boepd and 30,000 boepd in 2017. In 2017, the operator plans to drill two production wells from the existing platform rig, of which one well is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. The operator plans to continue a multi-year well abandonment program. • At Block A‑18 of the JDA, the operator, Carigali Hess Operating Company, continued drilling production wells and completed commissioning of its booster compression project in the third quarter of 2016. Production averaged 206 mmcfd (2015: 255 mmcfd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, with the decrease from prior-year primarily due to lower entitlement and downtime associated with commissioning of the new booster compression project. Production from the JDA is forecast to average approximately 210 mmcfd in 2017. • In the North Malay Basin (NMB), net production from the Early Production System averaged 26 mmcfd (2015: 40 mmcfd). In 2016, we completed the installation of three remote wellhead platforms and the jacket of the central processing platform. We also achieved mechanical completion of the central processing platform topsides and transport to the field via a heavy lift vessel is planned for the first quarter of 2017. The full field development project is planned for completion in the third quarter of 2017, after which net production is expected to increase to 165 mmcfd. • At the South Arne Field, offshore Denmark, we completed drilling of an eleven well multi-year program early in 2016. Net production averaged 13,000 boepd (2015: 13,000 boepd). In the fourth quarter, the Danish government awarded a 20 year extension to the South Arne Field license, extending expiry to 2047. Net production is forecast to average approximately 12,000 boepd in 2017. • In the Utica shale, we drilled and completed 6 wells and brought 14 wells onto production before suspending drilling activities during the first quarter of 2016 in response to low commodity prices. Net production increased to 29,000 boepd in 2016 (2015: 24,000 boepd) and is expected to average between 15,000 boepd and 20,000 boepd in 2017. • In Equatorial Guinea, net production was 33,000 boepd in 2016 down from 43,000 boepd in 2015 due to lower drilling activity and natural field decline. Net production in 2017 is expected to average approximately 25,000 boepd. • In Libya, civil and political unrest has largely interrupted production and crude oil export capability in 2016. At the Waha fields (Hess 8%), the operator recommenced production in October 2016 following the lifting of force majeure by the national oil company of Libya. Net production from the Waha fields averaged 1,000 boepd for the year. 24 Other E&P assets: • At the Hess operated Stampede development project (Hess 25%) in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico, the topsides deck was installed on the hull and fabrication and pre-commissioning of topsides continue as planned. We also completed installation of subsea equipment at both drill centers in the field, drilled one development well, and commenced drilling on one water injector well. In 2017, we plan to install the tension leg platform and topsides, complete the sub-sea installation and continue our drilling operations with introduction of a second drilling rig. First production from the field is targeted for 2018, and is expected to ramp up to a net rate of approximately 15,000 boepd. • In Guyana, at the offshore Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, completed a 3D seismic acquisition program covering approximately 17,000 square kilometers on the block and drilled two successful appraisal wells at the Liza discovery. The Liza-2 well was drilled to a total depth of 17,963 feet and encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in the Upper Cretaceous formations and included an extended drill stem test. The Liza-3 well was drilled to a total depth of 18,098 feet and encountered 210 feet of the same oil-bearing reservoirs encountered in other Liza wells. Pre-development planning and appraisal activities are underway and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of the Liza development in mid-2017 with first production expected in 2020. In 2016, the operator also drilled the Payara-1 exploration well at the Payara prospect, located approximately 10 miles northwest of the Liza discovery, and encountered more than 95 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. At the Skipjack prospect 25 miles northwest of the Liza discovery, the operator completed the drilling of an exploration well, which was unsuccessful and expensed. In 2017, the operator plans to drill a well at the Snoek exploration prospect, a Liza-4 appraisal well, and a Payara-2 appraisal well. In addition, the operator will evaluate additional exploration opportunities on the broader Stabroek block. • At the Equus project on Block WA-390-P in the offshore Carnarvon Basin of Australia, we were awarded a retention lease through 2021 covering certain areas within the WA-390-P License which include our Equus discoveries. In addition, we also completed drilling of an exploration commitment well at the WA-474-P License which is adjacent to Block WA-390-P. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we terminated a joint front-end engineering study with a third party natural gas liquefaction joint venture and notified the government of Australia of our intent to defer further development of the project. As a result, we recognized an after-tax charge of $693 million ($938 million pre-tax) to expense all previously capitalized exploratory well costs and other project related costs. • In Ghana, we continued development planning and subsurface evaluation. The government of Côte d’Ivoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of Ghana, which includes a portion of our Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license. We are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter, which may also impact our ability to develop the license. The International Tribunal for Law of the Sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017. Under terms of our license and subject to resolution of the border dispute, we have declared commerciality for four discoveries, including the Pecan Field in March 2016, which would be the primary development hub for the block. We are continuing to work with the government on how best to progress work on the block given the maritime border dispute. See Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs in Note 4, Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • At the non-operated Sicily prospect, in the Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where two exploration wells discovered hydrocarbons, we decided in 2016 not to pursue the project due to the low oil price environment and the limited time remaining on the leases. The costs of both wells were expensed in 2016. • At the non-operated Melmar prospect in the Alaminos Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the operator completed drilling of an exploration well in 2016, where noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons were encountered and well costs were expensed. The following is an update of significant Bakken Midstream activities during 2016: • We continued to progress the construction of facilities and the reconfiguration of pipelines in McKenzie and Williams counties that are expected to increase throughput capacity for crude oil and natural gas originating from south of the Missouri River for transporting north to our natural gas processing and crude oil and natural gas liquids logistics assets in Tioga and Ramberg and multiple third-party pipelines. 25 Liquidity, and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $795 million in 2016 (2015: $1,981 million; 2014: $4,457 million). At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $2,732 million (2015: $2,716 million) and total debt was $6,806 million (2015: $6,592 million). Our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2016 was 30.4% (2015: 24.4%).

Beginning January 1, 2017, Hess’s Midstream segment will include our interest in a Permian gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and water handling assets in North Dakota. These assets are wholly owned by the Corporation and are not included in our Hess Infrastructure Partners joint venture. 26 Consolidated Results of Operations The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions, except per share amounts) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation: Exploration and Production $ (4,963 ) $ (2,717 ) $ 2,086 Bakken Midstream 41 86 10 Corporate, Interest and Other (1,210 ) (377 ) (404 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (6,132 ) (3,008 ) 1,692 Discontinued operations — (48 ) 625 Total $ (6,132 ) $ (3,056 ) $ 2,317 Net Income (Loss) per Common Share - Diluted (a): Continuing operations $ (19.92 ) $ (10.61 ) $ 5.50 Discontinued operations — (0.17 ) 2.03 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Per Common Share - Diluted $ (19.92 ) $ (10.78 ) $ 7.53 (a) Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation less preferred stock dividends as applicable, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares. The following table summarizes, on an after-tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 32 through 36. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Exploration and Production $ (3,699 ) $ (1,851 ) $ 542 Bakken Midstream (21 ) — — Corporate, Interest and Other (923 ) (44 ) (74 ) Discontinued operations — (48 ) 541 Total Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods $ (4,643 ) $ (1,943 ) $ 1,009 In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after‑tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. The following table reconciles reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation and adjusted net income (loss): 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation $ (6,132 ) $ (3,056 ) $ 2,317 Less: Total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods (4,643 ) (1,943 ) 1,009 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ (1,489 ) $ (1,113 ) $ 1,308 “Adjusted net income (loss)” presented in this report is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income (loss). 27 Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of our E&P operations: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues $ 4,762 $ 6,636 $ 10,737 Gains on asset sales, net 26 31 817 Other, net 17 (61 ) (46 ) Total revenues and non-operating income 4,805 6,606 11,508 Costs and Expenses Cost of products sold (excluding items shown separately below) 1,095 1,409 1,826 Operating costs and expenses 1,697 1,764 1,815 Production and severance taxes 101 146 275 Bakken Midstream tariffs 478 449 212 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 1,442 881 840 General and administrative expenses 235 317 325 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3,132 3,852 3,140 Impairment — 1,616 — Total costs and expenses 8,180 10,434 8,433 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes (3,375 ) (3,828 ) 3,075 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 1,588 (1,111 ) 989 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ (4,963 ) $ (2,717 ) $ 2,086 Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 32, the changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, cost of products sold, cash operating costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, Bakken Midstream tariffs, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. 28 Selling Prices: Average realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 18% lower in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the declines in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. In addition, realized selling prices for natural gas liquids and natural gas declined in 2016 by 5% and 19%, respectively, compared to the prior year. In total, lower realized selling prices reduced 2016 financial results by approximately $440 million after income taxes compared with 2015. Our average selling prices were as follows: 2016 2015 2014 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Including Hedging) United States Onshore $ 36.92 $ 42.67 $ 81.89 Offshore 37.47 46.21 95.05 Total United States 37.13 44.01 87.21 Europe 43.33 55.10 104.21 Africa 41.88 53.89 97.31 Asia 42.98 52.74 89.71 Worldwide 39.20 47.85 92.59 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Excluding Hedging) United States Onshore $ 36.92 $ 41.22 $ 81.89 Offshore 37.47 46.21 92.22 Total United States 37.13 43.11 86.06 Europe 43.33 52.37 99.20 Africa 41.88 51.57 93.70 Asia 42.98 52.74 89.71 Worldwide 39.20 46.37 90.20 Natural Gas Liquids - Per Barrel United States Onshore $ 9.18 $ 9.18 $ 28.92 Offshore 13.96 14.40 30.40 Total United States 9.71 10.02 29.32 Europe 19.48 24.59 52.66 Worldwide 9.95 10.52 30.59 Natural Gas - Per Mcf United States Onshore $ 1.48 $ 1.64 $ 3.18 Offshore 1.99 2.03 3.79 Total United States 1.61 1.77 3.47 Europe 3.97 6.72 10.00 Asia 5.31 5.97 6.94 Worldwide 3.37 4.16 6.04 Crude oil price hedging contracts increased E&P Sales and other operating revenues by $126 million ($79 million after income taxes) in 2015 and $193 million ($121 million after income taxes) in 2014. There were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016. 29 Production Volumes: Our net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2016 2015 2014 (In thousands) Crude Oil - Barrels United States Bakken 68 81 66 Other Onshore 9 10 10 Total Onshore 77 91 76 Offshore 45 56 51 Total United States 122 147 127 Europe 33 38 36 Africa 34 51 54 Asia 2 2 3 Worldwide 191 238 220 Natural Gas Liquids - Barrels United States Bakken 27 20 10 Other Onshore 11 12 7 Total Onshore 38 32 17 Offshore 5 6 6 Total United States 43 38 23 Europe 1 1 1 Worldwide 44 39 24 Natural Gas - Mcf United States Bakken 61 64 40 Other Onshore 133 109 47 Total Onshore 194 173 87 Offshore 64 87 78 Total United States 258 260 165 Europe 43 43 36 Asia 222 282 312 Worldwide 523 585 513 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 322 375 329 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production 73 % 74 % 74 % We expect total net production to average between 300,000 boepd and 310,000 boepd in 2017, excluding any contribution from Libya. Our production has been decreasing the last several quarters as a result of reducing our capital expenditures to manage in the lower price environment. We expect our production will continue to decline in the first half of 2017 as a result of this reduced spend and a high level of planned maintenance at four of our offshore assets in the second quarter. We forecast production to average between 290,000 boepd and 300,000 boepd in the first quarter and between 270,000 boepd and 280,000 boepd in the second quarter. Production is then forecast to increase in the third quarter with the start-up of North Malay Basin and a new well at the Penn State Field in the Gulf of Mexico to between 305,000 boepd and 315,000 boepd. We expect our production will continue to grow in the fourth quarter as Bakken production increases as a result of the rig ramp up and the first new Valhall well comes online. Fourth quarter production is forecast to average between 330,000 boepd and 340,000 boepd. Production variances related to 2016, 2015 and 2014 can be summarized as follows: United States: Onshore crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in response to low oil prices, while the increase in natural gas liquids production was primarily due to greater processed volumes at the Tioga gas plant. Onshore natural gas production was higher in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a higher number of wells being on production in the Utica shale play relative to the prior year. Total offshore production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to subsurface valve failures in three wells at the Tubular Bells Field, a shut-in well to replace a subsurface valve at the Conger Field, extended planned shutdowns 30 on third-party hosted production facilities at the Tubular Bells and Conger Fields, and natural field decline. Onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to continued drilling in the Bakken oil shale play, while the increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to the Bakken and the Utica shale. Offshore production increased in 2015 relative to 2014 as higher production from the Tubular Bells Field, which came online in November 2014, was offset primarily by lower production from the Llano, Conger and Shenzi Fields. Europe: Crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower drilling activity, natural field decline and a planned shutdown at the Valhall Field, offshore Norway. Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells at the Valhall Field in 2015. Africa: Crude oil production in Africa was lower in 2016 compared to 2015, as a result of reduced drilling activity in Equatorial Guinea and the sale of our Algeria asset in the fourth quarter of 2015, where net production for 2015 amounted to 7,000 boepd. Crude oil production in Africa was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, due to Libyan production being shut-in. Force majeure declared by the national oil company of Libya was lifted in September 2016 and net production averaged 1,000 boepd in 2016. Asia: Natural gas production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the planned shutdown of production facilities at the JDA in 2016 to commission the booster compressor project and from lower production entitlement. Natural gas production was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to asset sales partially offset by higher production at the JDA as a result of higher facility uptime. Sales Volumes: The impact of lower sales volumes decreased after-tax results by approximately $540 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Our worldwide sales volumes were as follows: 2016 2015 2014 (In thousands) Crude oil - barrels 72,462 85,344 80,869 Natural gas liquids - barrels 16,055 14,400 8,793 Natural gas - mcf 191,482 213,195 187,381 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 120,431 135,277 120,892 Crude oil - barrels per day 198 234 222 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day 44 39 24 Natural gas - mcf per day 523 584 513 Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day 329 371 331 Cost of Products Sold: Cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third-parties, as well as rail transportation fees from our Bakken Midstream operating segment. The decrease in Cost of products sold in 2016 compared to 2015, and in 2015 compared to 2014, principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices. Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of Operating costs and expenses, Production and severance taxes and E&P General and administrative expenses, decreased by $194 million in 2016 compared with the prior year (2015: $188 million decrease versus 2014). The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to lower production and ongoing cost reduction efforts, and lower production taxes in the Bakken. Operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the Gulf of Mexico. The decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to cost reductions across the portfolio and lower production taxes in the Bakken, which were partially offset by higher operating costs at Tubular Bells where production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014. Bakken Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense in 2016 increased versus 2015 primarily due to increased oil gathering tariffs and minimum volume deficiency payments related to rail export services in 2016, partially offset by lower gas volumes processed through the Tioga gas plant. Higher tariff expense in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily reflects higher volumes processed through the Tioga gas plant which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 to complete a plant expansion and refurbishment project. For 2017, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense, which will include tariffs associated with our interests in a Permian gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets and water handling assets in North Dakota, to be in the range of $520 million to $550 million. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) costs decreased by $720 million in 2016 from 2015. The decrease resulted from lower production and an improved portfolio average DD&A rate due to the production mix. Higher production in 2015 from the Bakken, Tubular Bells and Utica fields, which had higher DD&A rates per barrel than the portfolio average, were the primarily drivers for the increase in DD&A costs in 2015 compared to 2014. 31 Unit costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P production volumes and exclude items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: Actual Forecast range 2016 2015 2014 2017 (a) Cash operating costs $ 15.87 $ 15.69 $ 20.01 $15.00 — $16.00 Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs 26.57 28.14 26.10 24.00 — 25.00 Total Production Unit Costs $ 42.44 $ 43.83 $ 46.11 $39.00 — $41.00 (a) Forecasted amounts assume no contribution from Libya. Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Exploratory dry hole costs $ 1,064 $ 410 $ 301 Exploratory lease and other impairment 145 182 207 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead 233 289 332 $ 1,442 $ 881 $ 840 Exploration expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher dry hole expense partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. Exploration expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher dry hole costs, partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. See items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below. For 2017, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. Income Taxes: The E&P income tax provision was an expense of $1,588 million in 2016, a benefit of $1,111 million in 2015 and an expense of $989 million in 2014. The income tax expense recognized in 2016, despite pre-tax losses, is the result of deferred income tax charges to establish valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets. Excluding the impact of these charges and other items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below and Libya, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations amounted to a benefit of 42% in 2016 (2015: 46% benefit; 2014: 37% charge). Based on current strip crude oil prices, we are forecasting a pre-tax loss for 2017. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods and Libyan operations, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 17% to 21%, which is lower than the comparable effective tax rate in 2016 due to our not recognizing a deferred tax benefit or expense commencing in 2017 in the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), and Malaysia until such time that deferred tax assets are re-established in these jurisdictions. See E&P items affecting comparability of earnings below and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Income Taxes on page 42. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Income tax $ — $ — $ — $ (2,869 ) $ 101 $ (48 ) Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses (1,021 ) (518 ) (304 ) (745 ) (301 ) (173 ) Offshore rig cost (105 ) — — (66 ) — — Inventory write-off (39 ) (87 ) — (19 ) (58 ) — Exit costs and other (26 ) (44 ) (28 ) (17 ) (37 ) (11 ) Impairments — (1,616 ) — — (1,566 ) — Gain on asset sales, net 27 28 801 17 10 774 $ (1,164 ) $ (2,237 ) $ 469 $ (3,699 ) $ (1,851 ) $ 542 32 The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) are presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income as follows: Before Income Taxes 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Gains on asset sales, net $ 27 $ 28 $ 801 Other, net — (14 ) — Cost of products sold — (39 ) (18 ) Operating costs and expenses (162 ) (51 ) — Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment (1,029 ) (518 ) (304 ) General and administrative expenses — (27 ) (10 ) Impairment — (1,616 ) — $ (1,164 ) $ (2,237 ) $ 469 2016: • Income taxes: We recorded a non-cash charge of $2,920 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. This deferred tax charge has no cash flow impact and the Corporation’s underlying tax position remains unchanged. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $51 million related to the resolution of certain international tax matters. • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $938 million ($693 million after income taxes) to write-off all previously capitalized wells and other project related costs for our Equus natural gas project, offshore the North West Shelf of Australia, following the decision to defer further development of the project. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $83 million ($52 million after income taxes) to write-off the previously capitalized Sicily-1 exploration well based on our decision not to pursue the project. • Offshore rig cost: We recognized a pre-tax charge of $105 million ($66 million after income taxes) related to an offshore drilling rig. • Inventory write-off: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $39 million ($19 million after income taxes) to write off surplus materials and supplies inventory. • Exit costs and other: We recorded pre-tax exit and other costs of $26 million ($17 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance. • Gains on asset sale, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $27 million ($17 million after income taxes) related to the sale of undeveloped onshore acreage in the United States. 2015: • Impairment: We recorded noncash goodwill impairment charges totaling $1,483 million pre-tax ($1,483 million after income taxes), representing all goodwill of our E&P segment, due to the decline in crude oil prices. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $133 million ($83 million after income taxes) associated with our legacy conventional North Dakota assets. • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recognized a pre-tax charge of $190 million ($86 million after income taxes) to write-off an exploration well, associated leasehold expenses and other costs related to the Dinarta Block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq following the decision of the Corporation and its partner to relinquish the block and exit operations in the region. In offshore Ghana, we expensed previously capitalized well costs of $182 million ($117 million after income taxes) primarily associated with natural gas discoveries due to insufficient progress on appraisal negotiations with the regulator. In offshore Australia, we expensed previously capitalized well costs of $62 million ($45 million after income taxes) associated with discovered resources that we determined would not be included in the development concept for the Equus project. In addition, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $84 million ($53 million after income taxes) primarily to impair exploration leases in the Gulf of Mexico. • Exit costs and other: We recognized pre-tax charges totaling $21 million ($21 million after income taxes) associated with terminated international office space and incurred charges of $23 million ($16 million after income taxes) related to employee severance and other expenses. • Inventory write-off: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $48 million ($30 million after income taxes) to write off 33 surplus drilling materials based on future drilling plans and recognized a pre-tax charge of $39 million ($28 million after income taxes) to reduce crude oil inventories to their net realizable value. • Gains on asset sales, net: We completed the sale of approximately 13,000 acres of Utica dry gas acreage for consideration of approximately $120 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $49 million ($31 million after income taxes). We also completed the sale of our producing assets in Algeria in December 2015 and recognized a pre-tax loss of $21 million ($21 million after income taxes). • Income taxes: In 2015, we recorded net tax benefits totaling $101 million, comprised primarily of $154 million to recognize a deferred tax benefit from a legal entity restructuring, $50 million benefit from receiving approval for an international investment incentive and a $112 million charge to recognize a partial valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets. 2014: • Gains on asset sales, net: We completed the sale of our producing assets in Thailand, 77,000 net acres of Utica dry gas acreage, including related wells and facilities, and an exploration asset in the United Kingdom North Sea. These divestitures generated total cash proceeds of $1,933 million and total pre-tax gains of $801 million ($774 million after income taxes). At the time of sale, these assets were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 19,000 boepd. • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded dry hole and other exploration expenses for the write-off of a previously capitalized exploration well in the western half of Block 469 in the Gulf of Mexico of $169 million ($105 million after income taxes) and other charges totaling $135 million pre-tax ($68 million after income taxes) to write-off leasehold acreage in the Paris Basin of France, the Shakrok Block in Kurdistan and our interest in a natural gas exploration project, offshore Sabah, Malaysia. • Exit costs and other: We recorded pre-tax severance and other exit costs of $28 million ($11 million after income taxes) resulting from our transformation to a more focused pure play E&P company. • Income taxes: We recorded an income tax charge of $48 million for remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from legal entity restructurings. Bakken Midstream Following is a summarized income statement of our Bakken Midstream operations: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Total revenues and non-operating income $ 510 $ 564 $ 319 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses 183 265 219 General and administrative expenses 17 14 11 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 102 88 70 Impairments 67 — — Interest expense 19 10 2 Total costs and expenses 388 377 302 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes 122 187 17 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 25 52 7 Net income (loss) 97 135 10 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (a) 56 49 — Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ 41 $ 86 $ 10 (a) The partnership is not subject to tax and, therefore, the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income is a pre-tax amount. Total revenues and non-operating income in 2016 decreased from 2015, primarily as a result of lower rail export revenue associated with third-party rail charges, partially offset by recognition of deferred minimum volume deficiency payments earned. Total revenues and non-operating income in 2015 improved from 2014 mainly due to higher throughput volumes at the Tioga gas plant. 34 Operating costs and expenses were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in third-party rail charges. Operating costs and expenses were higher in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to an increase in third‑party operating and maintenance expense. DD&A expenses were higher in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to capital expenditures on gathering pipelines and railcars that were placed in service. DD&A expenses were higher in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to a full year’s usage of the Tioga gas plant in 2015, which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 in connection with a large-scale expansion, refurbishment and optimization project. The increase in interest expense in 2016 and 2015 reflects borrowings by Hess Infrastructure Partners LP subsequent to its formation on July 1, 2015. For 2017, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million. In 2017, the Midstream segment will include our interests in a Permian gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and water handling assets in North Dakota in addition to assets that comprise our current Bakken Midstream segment. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Bakken Midstream 2016 results included a pre-tax charge of $67 million ($21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) to impair older specification rail cars. Corporate, Interest and Other The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 131 $ 219 $ 217 Interest expense 380 376 397 Less: Capitalized interest (61 ) (45 ) (76 ) Interest expense, net 319 331 321 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes 450 550 538 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (163 ) (217 ) (208 ) Net Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes 287 333 330 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after-tax 923 44 74 Total Corporate, Interest and Other Expenses After Income Taxes $ 1,210 $ 377 $ 404 Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were lower in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reductions in employee costs, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses, and the benefit of higher interest income and non-operating income. Corporate and other expenses for 2014 include a pre-tax gain of $13 million ($8 million after income taxes) related to the disposition of our 50% interest in a joint venture involved in the construction of an electric generating facility in Newark, New Jersey. Excluding the gain, 2015 costs are down compared to 2014 primarily due to lower employee costs and other expenses. In 2017 pre-tax corporate expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Interest expense was comparable in 2016 compared to 2015, but capitalized interest expense increased over the same period with 2016 reflecting increased activity at the Hess operated Stampede development project. Interest expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, as lower interest rates offset higher average borrowings. Capitalized interest was also lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on the Tubular Bells Field upon first production in the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2017 pre-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $295 million to $305 million. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: 2016: • Income tax: We recorded a non-cash charge of $829 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. This deferred tax charge has no cash flow impact and the Corporation’s underlying tax position remains unchanged. • Loss on debt extinguishment: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $148 million ($92 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase and redemption of notes to complete a debt refinancing. See Note 12, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 • Exit costs and other: We recorded pre-tax exit and other costs of $3 million ($2 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance. 2015: • HOVENSA LLC: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $76 million ($49 million after income taxes) associated with debtor-in-possession financing provided to HOVENSA LLC and the estimated liability resulting from its bankruptcy resolution. • Other: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $20 million ($13 million after income taxes) from the sale of land and incurred exit costs of $6 million pre-tax ($4 million after income taxes). 2014: • Impairment: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $84 million ($52 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of our equity investment in the Bayonne Energy Center to fair value. • Other: We incurred severance charges of $19 million pre-tax ($12 million after income taxes) and exit related costs of $15 million pre-tax ($10 million after income taxes). Discontinued Operations – Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods Discontinued operations attributable to Hess Corporation incurred a net loss of $48 million in 2015 compared to a net income of $625 million in 2014. Discontinued operations included ownership of an energy trading partnership through February 2015 and retail marketing through September 2014. In September 2014, we completed the sale of our retail business for cash proceeds of approximately $2.8 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $954 million ($602 million after income taxes). During 2014, we recorded pre-tax gains of $275 million ($171 million after income taxes) relating to the liquidation of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventories associated with the divested downstream operations. In addition, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $308 million ($202 million after income taxes) in 2014 for impairments, environmental matters, severance and exit related activities associated with the divestiture of downstream operations. We also recognized in 2014 a pre-tax charge of $115 million ($72 million after income taxes) related to the termination of lease contracts and the purchase of 180 retail gasoline stations in preparation for the sale of the retail operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2016 2015 (In millions, except ratio) Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,732 $ 2,716 Current maturities of long-term debt 112 86 Total debt (a) 6,806 6,592 Total equity 15,591 20,401 Debt to capitalization ratio (b) 30.4 % 24.4 % (a) Includes $733 million of debt outstanding from our Bakken Midstream joint venture at December 31, 2016 (2015: $704 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. (b) Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. 36 Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Cash Flows From Operating Activities: Cash provided by (used in) operating activities - continuing operations $ 795 $ 2,016 $ 4,504 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities - discontinued operations — (35 ) (47 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 795 1,981 4,457 Cash Flows From Investing Activities: Additions to property, plant and equipment - E&P (1,979 ) (3,956 ) (4,867 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment - Bakken Midstream (272 ) (365 ) (347 ) Proceeds from asset sales 140 50 2,978 Other, net 21 (44 ) (192 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations (2,090 ) (4,315 ) (2,428 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities - discontinued operations — 109 2,436 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (2,090 ) (4,206 ) 8 Cash Flows From Financing Activities: Cash provided by (used in) financing activities - continuing operations 1,311 2,497 (3,828 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities - discontinued operations — — (7 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 1,311 2,497 (3,835 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents from Continuing Operations 16 198 (1,752 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents from Discontinued Operations — 74 2,382 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 16 $ 272 $ 630 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $795 million in 2016, $1,981 million in 2015 and $4,457 million in 2014, primarily reflecting declining benchmark crude oil prices and changes in production volumes. Investing Activities: The decrease in Additions to property, plant and equipment in 2016, as compared to 2015, is primarily due to reduced drilling activity (Bakken, Utica, Norway, Denmark and Equatorial Guinea) and reduced development expenditures (Tubular Bells, North Malay Basin and the JDA). The decrease in Additions to property, plant and equipment in 2015, as compared to 2014, is primarily due to reduced drilling activity (Bakken, Utica, Norway and Equatorial Guinea), reduced development expenditures at Tubular Bells and the JDA, and lower exploratory drilling activity (Ghana and Kurdistan). These reductions were offset by 2015 activity related to development activities at Stampede in the Gulf of Mexico and exploration drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Guyana, and full field development at North Malay Basin. Total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to $140 million in 2016 (2015: $50 million; 2014: $2,978 million). In 2014, we completed asset sales of our dry gas acreage in the Utica shale play, our assets in Thailand, the Pangkah Field, offshore Indonesia, and our interests in two power plant joint ventures. In 2014, net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations included proceeds of $2.8 billion from the sale of the retail business. In addition, we acquired our partners’ 56% interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline joint venture, for approximately $290 million and we incurred capital expenditures of $105 million related to the acquisition of previously leased retail gasoline stations. Financing Activities: In 2016, total borrowings were $1.54 billion and total repayments of debt were $1.46 billion. In the first quarter of 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for total net proceeds of $1.64 billion. In 2015, we received net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion from the sale of a 50% interest in our Bakken Midstream business. Upon formation of the joint venture, HIP issued $600 million of debt under a Term Loan A facility. The proceeds from the debt were distributed equally to the partners. We purchased common stock under our $6.5 billion Board authorized stock repurchase plan of $142 million in 2015 and $3,715 million in 2014. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $350 million in 2016 (2015: $287 million; 2014: $303 million). 37 Future Capital Requirements and Resources At December 31, 2016, we had $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $7.3 billion. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S., which we have the ability to repatriate without triggering a U.S. cash tax liability, amounted to $287 million at December 31, 2016. Net production in 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 300,000 boepd to 310,000 boepd, excluding any contribution from Libya and we expect our 2017 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.25 billion. Based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2017, which are higher than 2016 prices, we forecast a smaller net loss and net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect to fund our projected net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) through 2017 with cash on hand. Due to the low commodity price environment, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: further reduce our planned capital program and other cash outlays, borrow from our committed credit facilities, issue debt or equity securities, and pursue asset sales. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2016: Letters of Expiration Credit Available Date Capacity Borrowings Issued Total Used Capacity (In millions) Revolving credit facility - Hess Corporation January 2020 $ 4,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,000 Revolving credit facility - HIP(a) July 2020 400 153 — 153 247 Committed lines Various (b) 575 — 1 1 574 Uncommitted lines Various (b) 187 — 187 187 — Total $ 5,162 $ 153 $ 188 $ 341 $ 4,821 (a) This credit facility may only be utilized by HIP and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. (b) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2018. Hess Corporation has a $4.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in January 2020. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.3% above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered. The facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 65% of the Corporation’s total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2016, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant. We had $188 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2016 (2015: $113 million), which primarily relate to our international operations. See also Note 24, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. HIP has a $400 million 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility, which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures. Borrowings generally bear interest at the LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.10% to 1.70%. The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on HIP’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). If HIP obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facility contains financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as EBITDA to interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. HIP is in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, borrowings under HIP’s revolving credit facility, which are non-recourse to Hess Corporation, amounted to $153 million. HIP also has a five-year Term Loan A loan facility with outstanding borrowings of $585 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, which is also non-recourse to Hess Corporation. We also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. 38 Credit Ratings Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. In February 2016, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered our credit rating to Ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade. In December 2016, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook. In February 2017, S&P re-affirmed our investment grade credit rating of BBB- with stable outlook. The consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements. As of December 31, 2016, based on our current credit ratings, we may be required to issue additional collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately $270 million. If Fitch or S&P were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade, we estimate that we could be required to issue additional letters of credit up to $200 million as of December 31, 2016. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2016: Payments Due by Period 2018 and 2020 and Total 2017 2019 2021 Thereafter (In millions) Total Debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 6,806 $ 112 $ 571 $ 598 $ 5,525 Operating Leases 1,631 376 726 191 338 Purchase Obligations: Capital expenditures 708 632 76 — — Operating expenses 497 393 76 18 10 Transportation and related contracts 1,560 182 457 433 488 Asset retirement obligations 2,128 216 479 191 1,242 Other liabilities 983 140 157 145 541 (a) We anticipate cash payments for interest of $397 million for 2017, $760 million for 2018-2019, $670 million for 2020-2021, and $4,514 million thereafter for a total of $6,341 million. Capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at December 31, 2016, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2017. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, lease drilling rigs, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2016, we have $27 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable. See also Note 21, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations We conduct exploration and production activities outside the U.S., principally in Europe (Norway and Denmark), Africa (Equatorial Guinea, Libya, and Ghana), Asia (Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand and Malaysia), Australia, South America (Guyana and Suriname) and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, corruption, acts of terrorism, tax law changes and currency risk. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details. 39 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year. Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. For example, the average WTI crude oil price used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $42.68, $50.13, and $94.42 per barrel, respectively. The lower prices for 2016 and 2015 relative to 2014 resulted in negative revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 of 29 million boe (2015: 234 million boe). If crude oil prices in 2017 are at levels below that used in determining 2016 proved reserves, we may recognize further negative revisions to our December 31, 2016 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2017 above those used in determining 2016 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2017 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2017 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2016 would result in an approximate $300 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2017. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 84 through 94 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves. Bakken Midstream Joint Venture: On July 1, 2015, we sold a 50% interest in HIP to GIP for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion. We consolidate the activities of HIP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered HIP’s 40 governance structure, the commercial agreements between HIP and us, and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of HIP. Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. Our impairment tests of long‑lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. We could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. As a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices, we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment. See Note 6, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. Prior to the second quarter of 2015, we had one operating segment, E&P consisting of two reporting units, Offshore and Onshore which reflected the manner in which performance was assessed by the Operating segment manager. In the second quarter of 2015 we established a second operating segment, Bakken Midstream, which previously was part of the Onshore reporting unit. Prior to the formation of the Bakken Midstream operating segment the Offshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $1,098 million while the Onshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $760 million. Upon formation of the Bakken Midstream operating segment, we allocated $375 million of goodwill from the Onshore reporting unit to the Bakken Midstream operating segment based on the relative fair values of the Bakken Midstream business and the remainder of the Onshore reporting unit. There was no change to the composition of the Offshore reporting unit. In step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination. The resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded. Our fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control and increased market share. The determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. We also consider the relative market valuation of similar peer companies, and other market data if available, in determining fair value of a reporting unit. In addition, a qualitative reconciliation of our market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two. If a reporting unit fails step one, it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value. 41 As there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset. In the second quarter of 2015, we performed impairment tests on the Offshore and Onshore reporting units in accordance with accounting standards for goodwill immediately prior to creation of the Bakken Midstream operating segment. No impairment resulted from this assessment. In addition, accounting standards require that following a reorganization, allocated goodwill should be tested for impairment. We also performed impairment tests on the allocated goodwill for the Bakken Midstream and the Onshore reporting unit at June 30, 2015. Goodwill allocated to the Bakken Midstream operating segment passed the impairment test but the goodwill allocated to the Onshore reporting unit did not pass the impairment test. As a result, we recorded a noncash pre-tax charge of $385 million ($385 million after income taxes) in the second quarter of 2015 to reflect the Onshore reporting unit’s goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards. As a result of the decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed an impairment test at December 31, 2015 on the Offshore reporting unit and determined its goodwill was impaired. We recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1,098 million ($1,098 million after income taxes) to reflect the Offshore reporting unit’s goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards. Effective January 1, 2017, as part of a reorganization of our E&P business, the Onshore and Offshore reporting units were combined within the E&P operating segment, which had no goodwill at December 31, 2016. This reorganization had no impact on the composition of the Bakken Midstream operating segment. We expect that the benefits of our remaining goodwill totaling $375 million assigned to the Bakken Midstream operating segment will be recovered based on market conditions at December 31, 2016. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year. Due to a sustained low commodity price environment we experienced a three-year cumulative consolidated loss as of December 31, 2016. A three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. As of December 31, 2016, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $5,450 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above, with $3,749 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related primarily to the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), and Malaysia. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth. We do not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any 42 legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. In order to measure these obligations, we estimate the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long‑term rates of return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels, and participant mortality assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements. Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. 43 Environment, Health and Safety Our long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. We are committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions mandates and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities, sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2016, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $10 million in 2016 (2015: $13 million; 2014: $12 million). The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 44 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As discussed in Note 24, Financial Risk Management Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options to affect risk management activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them: • Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third-parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound and Danish Krone which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: We may use exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and have the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. Financial Risk Management Activities We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of $785 million at December 31, 2016 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $5 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding long‑term debt of $6,806 million, including current maturities, had a fair value of $7,548 million. A 15% increase or decrease in the rate of interest would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately $510 million or $580 million, respectively. We have no outstanding commodity price hedges at December 31, 2016. 45 Item 8.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chief Executive Officer February 23, 2017 47 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries, and our report dated February 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York February 23, 2017 48 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.

Risk Factors Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below. These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, liquidity, financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, and our associated realized price differentials, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of OPEC, may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets. Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions, the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally. The sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Average prices for 2017 were $50.85 per barrel for WTI (2016: $43.47; 2015: $48.76) and $54.74 per barrel for Brent (2016: $45.13; 2015: $53.60). In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain significant bank credit facilities. An inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves, which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions, which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Similar risks, however, may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement, replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. Crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016, relative to preceding years, resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves. In contrast, crude oil prices improved somewhat in 2017 resulting in increases to our reported proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2018 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2017, it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business. See Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that 14 are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. For example, in 2017, we had a significant net loss and, unless commodity prices are considerably higher through 2018, we are forecasting a net loss for 2018. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, geographic territorial border disputes, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political and civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase 15 our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, in 2017 certain municipalities in California separately filed lawsuits against over 30 fossil fuel producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. To a lesser extent, we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, including wind, solar and electric power, and in the future could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‑made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‑attacks. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent, including for property and casualty losses. There can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. As part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures. This may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows. Departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. Our future success depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy. The departure of key members of senior management or an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. An inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost. These consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. We manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into additional commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility. One of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, Hess Midstream Partners LP. The responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose the us to a broader range of legal liabilities. Our control of Hess Midstream Partners LP bestows upon us additional fiduciary duties including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests, additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the provision of tax information to unit holders of Hess Midstream Partners LP. These heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders. Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs and may divert management resource from our other operations. 16 Disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the Company may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, a disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are four remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state, have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been removed to Federal court and has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. The suit filed in Vermont is proceeding there in a state court. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Rhode Island is proceeding in Federal court. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Maryland was filed in state court, but has not been served to date. In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and also agreed with EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not 17 believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because there are numerous other parties who we expect will share in the cost of remediation and damages and our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length. In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. The remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. EPA has estimated that this remedy will cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected ship-building and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. We indicated to EPA that we would comply with the Administrative Order and are currently contributing funding for the Remedial Design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties. At the same time, we are participating in an allocation process whereby a neutral expert selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the Remedial Design costs to be paid by each of the participants. On September 28, 2017, we received a general notice letter and offer to settle from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency relating to Superfund claims for the Ector Drum, Inc. Superfund Site in Odessa, TX. The EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) took clean-up and response action at the site commencing in 2014 and concluded in December 2015. The site was determined to have improperly stored industrial waste, including drums with oily liquids. The total clean-up cost incurred by the EPA was approximately $3.5 million. We were invited to negotiate a voluntary settlement for our purported share of the clean-up costs. Our share, if any, is undetermined. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, such as those discussed above, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, the EPA’s claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of the aforementioned proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. The Corporation conducts exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, Suriname, Canada and in the Gulf of Mexico, including at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, where we have participated in six significant crude oil discoveries and sanctioned the first phase of a multi-phase development project at the Liza Field. During 2017, we sold our interests in Equatorial Guinea, Norway and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin, onshore U.S. The 2017 asset sales of higher cost, mature assets will provide funds toward our future development projects in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we announced that we would commence a process to sell our interests in Denmark in 2018. These actions reflect the execution of our strategy to grow our resource base in a capital disciplined manner and to be cash generative at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price post 2020. The Corporation’s Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids (NGLs); gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; and storing and terminaling propane, primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. Beginning January 1, 2017, Hess’ Midstream segment included our interest in a Permian gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and water handling assets in North Dakota as a result of organizational changes to the management of those assets. Prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 22, Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the third quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of our Midstream assets in the Permian Basin. See Note 2, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Outlook The Corporation and its partners have discovered significant crude oil and natural gas resources on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, which will require substantial capital and time to fully develop. As a result of these discovered fields, which are expected to have a lower development cost than other assets in our portfolio, we have changed the priorities of our future investment plans, and have divested of higher cost, mature assets to provide funds toward future development of Guyana. In addition, we have announced plans to reduce debt and repurchase common stock. We project our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.1 billion in 2018, up from $2.0 billion in 2017, reflecting increased activity at the Liza Field development project and a higher rig count in the Bakken, partially offset by lower spend at the Stampede Field and North Malay Basin development projects. Capital expenditures, including equity investments, for our Midstream operations are expected to be approximately $330 million. Oil and gas production in 2018 is forecast to be in the range of 245,000 boepd to 255,000 boepd excluding any contribution from Libya and reflecting an estimated 15,000 boepd reduction due to the extended Enchilada platform shutdown, up from 242,000 boepd in 2017, excluding Libya and assets sold. Net cash provided by operating activities was $945 million in 2017, compared to $795 million in 2016, while capital expenditures for 2017 and 2016 were $1,973 million and $1,921 million, respectively. Based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we forecast a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2018. The Corporation expects to fund its 2018 net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures), reduce debt by $500 million and repurchase $380 million of common stock with existing cash and cash equivalents, which was $4.5 billion at December 31, 2017, excluding Midstream. Consolidated Results Net loss attributable to Hess Corporation was $4,074 million in 2017 (2016: $6,132 million; 2015: $3,056 million). Excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 26, the adjusted net loss was $1,401 million in 2017 (2016: $1,489 million; 2015: $1,113 million). Annual production averaged 306,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 322,000 boepd; 2015: 375,000 boepd). Total proved reserves were 1,154 million boe at December 31, 2017 (2016: 1,109 million boe; 2015: 1,086 million boe). 22 Significant 2017 Activities The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2017: Producing E&P assets: • In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged 105,000 boepd (2016: 105,000 boepd). During 2017, we operated an average of 3.5 rigs, drilled 85 wells, completed 68 wells, and brought on production 68 wells, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,315 at December 31, 2017. Drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $5.6 million in 2017, based on a change in our standard well design during the year to a 60-stage completion with proppant loadings of 140,000 pounds per stage compared to an average well cost of $4.8 million in 2016 using a 50-stage completion with proppant loadings of 70,000 pounds per stage. During 2018, we plan to increase our rig count in the second half of the year from four to six rigs, to drill approximately 120 wells and bring approximately 95 wells on production. In addition, our capital budget for 2018 will fund pad construction in preparation for 2019 drilling. We forecast net production for full year 2018 to be in the range of 115,000 boepd to 120,000 boepd. • In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 54,000 boepd (2016: 61,000 boepd). The decrease in production was primarily due to a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform and natural field decline, partially offset by higher production at the Tubular Bells Field. Prior to the shutdown of the Enchilada platform in November, we were producing approximately 30,000 boepd from the Llano, Conger, Baldpate and Penn State Fields through infrastructure associated with Enchilada. At the Penn State Field, we competed one well in November 2017. In 2018, Gulf of Mexico production is forecast to average approximately 50,000 boepd, which reflects an estimated full year production impact of approximately 15,000 boepd associated with Enchilada. At the Hess operated Stampede development project in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico, in 2017 we completed installation of the tension leg platform and subsea equipment, finished drilling and completing three production wells, and received regulatory approval for production operations at the end of the year. In January 2018, we commenced production from the field, which is expected to ramp up over the next 18 months as we continue a drilling program of three additional production wells and four water injection wells. • In Block A‑18 of the JDA, net production averaged 223 mmcfd (2016: 206 mmcfd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, with the increase from prior-year primarily due to the planned shutdown in 2016 to commission the booster compressor project. Production from the JDA is forecast to average approximately 215 mmcfd in 2018. • In the North Malay Basin (NMB), production of natural gas commenced from the full-field development in July and net production averaged 66 mmcfd for the year (2016: 26 mmcfd). The field achieved the planned plateau rate of 165 mmcfd, and we forecast net production from NMB to average approximately 160 mmcfd in 2018. We plan to drill three production wells in 2018 and progress development activities related to future phases. • In the Utica shale, net production decreased to 19,000 boepd (2016: 29,000 boepd) due to natural decline following the suspension of drilling activities in the first quarter of 2016. In 2018, we expect to complete and bring on production five previously drilled wells. • In Libya, net production from the Waha Fields averaged approximately 10,000 boepd (2016: 1,000 boepd), with the increase from prior-year due to the lifting of force majeure by the national oil company of Libya in September 2016. • We sold our interests in Equatorial Guinea and Norway, and enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin. See Note 2, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other E&P assets: • In Guyana, at the Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited operated offshore Stabroek Block (Hess 30% participating interest), the partners sanctioned the first phase of the Liza Field development in 2017. This phase is expected to have a gross capital cost of approximately $3.2 billion for drilling and subsea infrastructure, of which we expect to incur $250 million net in 2018, with first production expected in March 2020. The development plan includes a leased floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel that will have the capacity to process up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day from 17 wells, including eight producers, six water injectors and three gas injectors. An application for an environmental permit to develop the second phase at Liza has been submitted. The concept for Phase 2 involves the use of a larger FPSO vessel and subsea systems that would have a production 23 capacity of approximately 220,000 bopd, with first production expected by mid-2022. Planning is also underway for a third phase of development with an FPSO vessel at the Payara Field with first production planned for 2023 or 2024. The size of the third ship will depend upon the results of future exploration and appraisal drilling. In 2017, the following wells were drilled on the Stabroek Block (in chronological order): Payara-1: The well, located approximately 10 miles northwest of the Liza discovery, encountered 95 feet of high-quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. Snoek-1: The well encountered more than 82 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs and is located approximately 5 miles southeast of the Liza-1 oil discovery. Liza-4: The well encountered more than 197 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Payara-2: The well encountered 59 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs and confirmed a second large oil field in addition to the Liza Field. The well is located approximately 12 miles northwest from the Liza Phase 1 project. Turbot-1: The well encountered a reservoir of 75 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone in the primary objective. The well is located approximately 30 miles to the southeast of the Liza Phase 1 project. In January 2018, the operator announced a sixth oil discovery at the Ranger prospect. The Ranger-1 well encountered approximately 230 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir, and is located approximately 60 miles to the northwest of the Liza Field. In 2018, additional drilling is planned, including appraisal of the Liza, Turbot and Ranger discoveries, as well as a wider exploration program that will target additional prospects and play types on the block. Drilling of the Pacora prospect commenced in January. • In Ghana, at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license (Hess 50% license interest), management determined in the fourth quarter of 2017 that it would not develop the previously discovered fields. As a result, we recorded a charge of $280 million to write-off previously capitalized exploration wells and other lease costs. See Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs in Note 5, Property, Plant and Equipment, and Note 24, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2017: • In the second quarter, Hess Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership”), sold 16,997,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price of $23 per unit in an initial public offering (IPO) for net proceeds of $365.5 million, of which $350 million was distributed 50/50 to Hess Corporation and GIP. See Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties. • In the fourth quarter, HIP, issued $800 million of 5.625% senior notes, due in February 2026 and concurrently amended its senior unsecured credit facilities. HIP used a portion of the proceeds from the note issuance to repay borrowings under HIP’s credit facilities and to fund a distribution to the partners. The remaining proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes of the joint venture. Under the amended credit facilities, the 5-year Term Loan A facility was reduced to $200 million and the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility increased to $600 million from $400 million previously, with the maturity of both facilities extended to November 2022. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of HIP’s and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ directly owned assets, including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries, subject to customary exclusions. The 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility is expected to continue to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures. During 2017, the Midstream segment brought online key strategic projects, including safe and successful start-up of the Hawkeye Gas Facility, the Hawkeye Oil Facility and the Johnson’s Corner Header System. These projects have increased the Midstream segment’s throughput volumes, customer optionality and system connectivity. Hess Midstream has also recently executed a strategic gas processing joint venture with Targa Resources Corp. that will further support the production growth in the Bakken. 24 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act The enactment of U.S. federal tax reform, commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”), provided for broad changes to the taxation of both domestic and foreign operations. The provisions of the Act, including its extensive transition rules, are complex and interpretive guidance continues to develop. Final application of the Act to our operations and financial results may differ from that for which we have provisionally provided as of December 31, 2017. Changes could arise as regulatory and interpretive action continues to clarify aspects of the Act and as changes are made to estimates that the Corporation has utilized in calculating the transition impacts. No U.S. federal tax has been accrued on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. A decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% resulted in a $1,476 million reduction to our U.S. federal net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017, with a corresponding reduction in the previously established U.S. valuation allowance. A deferred tax liability of $110 million no longer meets the recognition criteria with the transition to a territorial regime for U.S. taxation of foreign earnings and has been derecognized, with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance against the U.S. federal net deferred tax asset. Under the transition rules related to the repeal of the alternative minimum tax regime, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of $4 million will be refundable if not used to offset regular tax liability. The previously established valuation allowance against this credit carryforward has been released. Consequently, these tax law changes resulted in a net $4 million increase to net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and benefit to deferred tax expense. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $945 million (2016: $795 million; 2015: $1,981 million). At December 31, 2017, consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $4,847 million (2016: $2,732 million), consolidated debt was $6,977 million (2016: $6,806 million), and our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio was 36.1% (2016: 30.4%). Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures United States Bakken $ 624 $ 429 $ 1,308 Other Onshore 30 46 328 Total Onshore 654 475 1,636 Offshore 702 735 923 Total United States 1,356 1,210 2,559 Europe 142 65 298 Africa 30 10 161 Asia and other 519 586 1,020 E&P - Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 2,047 $ 1,871 $ 4,038 Exploration expenses charged to income included in E&P capital and exploratory expenditures above were: 2017 2016 2015 United States $ 90 $ 93 $ 132 International 105 140 157 Total Exploration Expenses Charged to Income included above $ 195 $ 233 $ 289 2017 2016 2015 Midstream Capital Expenditures Midstream - Capital Expenditures $ 121 $ 283 $ 300 In 2018, we plan to incur approximately $2.1 billion on E&P capital and exploratory expenditures, and approximately $330 million on Midstream capital expenditures, including equity investments. 25 Consolidated Results of Operations Results Including Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions, except per share amounts) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation: Exploration and Production $ (3,653 ) $ (4,964 ) $ (2,727 ) Midstream 42 42 96 Corporate, Interest and Other (463 ) (1,210 ) (377 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (4,074 ) (6,132 ) (3,008 ) Discontinued operations — — (48 ) Total $ (4,074 ) $ (6,132 ) $ (3,056 ) Net Income (Loss) per Common Share - Diluted (a): Continuing operations $ (13.12 ) $ (19.92 ) $ (10.61 ) Discontinued operations — — (0.17 ) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Per Common Share - Diluted $ (13.12 ) $ (19.92 ) $ (10.78 ) (a) Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation less preferred stock dividends, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares. In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: The following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 36. 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Exploration and Production $ (2,609 ) $ (3,699 ) $ (1,851 ) Midstream (34 ) (21 ) — Corporate, Interest and Other (30 ) (923 ) (44 ) Discontinued operations — — (48 ) Total Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods, After-Tax $ (2,673 ) $ (4,643 ) $ (1,943 ) The following table reconciles reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation and adjusted net income (loss): 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation $ (4,074 ) $ (6,132 ) $ (3,056 ) Less: Total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods (2,673 ) (4,643 ) (1,943 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ (1,401 ) $ (1,489 ) $ (1,113 ) Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation presented in this report is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income (loss). 26 The following table presents pre-tax items affecting comparability of income (expense) by line item that are included in the Statement of Consolidated Income on page 50. The items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 36.

In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for natural gas liquids increased in 2017 by 84% and worldwide natural gas prices remained unchanged, compared to the prior year. In total, higher realized selling prices improved 2017 financial results by approximately $350 million after income taxes compared with 2016. Our average selling prices were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Including Hedging) United States Onshore $ 46.04 $ 36.92 $ 42.67 Offshore 47.34 37.47 46.21 Total United States 46.50 37.13 44.01 Europe 55.03 43.33 55.10 Africa 53.17 41.88 53.89 Asia 56.99 42.98 52.74 Worldwide 49.23 39.20 47.85 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Excluding Hedging) United States Onshore $ 46.76 $ 36.92 $ 41.22 Offshore 48.15 37.47 46.21 Total United States 47.25 37.13 43.11 Europe 55.14 43.33 52.37 Africa 53.25 41.88 51.57 Asia 56.99 42.98 52.74 Worldwide 49.75 39.20 46.37 Natural Gas Liquids - Per Barrel United States Onshore $ 17.67 $ 9.18 $ 9.18 Offshore 21.34 13.96 14.40 Total United States 18.10 9.71 10.02 Europe 29.04 19.48 24.59 Worldwide 18.35 9.95 10.52 Natural Gas - Per Mcf United States Onshore $ 1.96 $ 1.48 $ 1.64 Offshore 2.22 1.99 2.03 Total United States 2.03 1.61 1.77 Europe 4.42 3.97 6.72 Asia and other 4.27 5.31 5.97 Worldwide 3.37 3.37 4.16 During 2017, we purchased Brent crude oil price collars to hedge 20,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) with a weighted average contract life of 10.3 months in 2017. The collars had a floor price of $55 per barrel and a ceiling price of $75 per barrel. We also purchased West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price collars to hedge 110,000 bopd with a weighted average contract life of 7.6 months in 2017 that had a floor price of $50 per barrel and an average ceiling price of $69 per barrel. At December 31, 2017, we have open WTI crude oil price collars with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $65 per barrel with a notional amount of 115,000 bopd for full year 2018. See Note 23, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Realized and unrealized movements in crude oil price collars decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $59 million ($59 million after income taxes) in 2017 and increased Sales and other operating revenues by $126 million ($79 million after income taxes) in 2015. There were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016. 28 Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (In thousands) Crude Oil - Barrels United States Bakken 67 68 81 Other Onshore 6 9 10 Total Onshore 73 77 91 Offshore 39 45 56 Total United States 112 122 147 Europe 28 33 38 Africa 35 34 51 Asia 2 2 2 Worldwide 177 191 238 Natural Gas Liquids - Barrels United States Bakken 28 27 20 Other Onshore 8 11 12 Total Onshore 36 38 32 Offshore 5 5 6 Total United States 41 43 38 Europe 1 1 1 Worldwide 42 44 39 Natural Gas - Mcf United States Bakken 62 61 64 Other Onshore 92 133 109 Total Onshore 154 194 173 Offshore 57 64 87 Total United States 211 258 260 Europe 33 43 43 Asia and other 276 222 282 Worldwide 520 523 585 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 306 322 375 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production 72 % 73 % 74 % In 2018, we expect net production, excluding Libya and reflecting an estimated 15,000 boepd reduction due to the extended Enchilada platform shutdown, to average between 245,000 boepd and 255,000 boepd, compared to full year pro forma 2017 net production, excluding Libya and assets sold, of 242,000 boepd. Production variances related to 2017, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows: United States: Onshore crude oil production was lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. Onshore natural gas production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to natural decline in the Utica shale play. Total offshore production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016, due to production from several fields being shut-in following a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in November 2017 and natural field decline, partially offset by higher production from the Tubular Bells Field. Onshore crude oil production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in response to low oil prices, while the increase in natural gas liquids production was primarily due to greater processed volumes at the Tioga gas plant. Onshore natural gas production was higher in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a higher number of wells being on production in the Utica shale play relative to the prior year. Total offshore production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to subsurface valve failures in three wells at the Tubular Bells Field, a shut-in well to replace a subsurface valve at the Conger Field, extended planned shutdowns on third-party hosted production facilities at the Tubular Bells and Conger Fields, and natural field decline. Our interests in Permian, which were sold in August, averaged net production of 4,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 7,000 boepd; 2015: 9,000 boepd). 29 Europe: Crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to natural field decline. Crude oil production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to lower drilling activity, natural field decline and a planned shutdown at the Valhall Field, offshore Norway. Our interests in Norway, which were sold in December, averaged net production of 24,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 28,000 boepd; 2015: 33,000 boepd). Africa: Crude oil production in 2017 was comparable to 2016, as lower volumes from Equatorial Guinea, which was sold in November 2017, was offset by higher production in Libya. Crude oil production in Africa was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, as a result of reduced drilling activity in Equatorial Guinea and the sale of our Algeria asset in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our interests in Equatorial Guinea averaged net production of 25,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 33,000 boepd; 2015: 43,000 boepd). Asia: Natural gas production was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to first production at the North Malay Basin full-field development in July 2017. Natural gas production was lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to the planned shutdown of production facilities at the JDA in 2016 to commission a booster compressor project and from lower production entitlement. Sales Volumes: The impact of lower sales volumes decreased after-tax results by approximately $190 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, excluding purchased crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (In thousands) Crude oil - barrels 63,367 72,462 85,344 Natural gas liquids - barrels 15,152 16,055 14,400 Natural gas - mcf 190,089 191,482 213,195 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 110,201 120,431 135,277 Crude oil - barrels per day 173 198 234 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day 42 44 39 Natural gas - mcf per day 520 523 584 Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day 302 329 371 Marketing, including purchased oil and gas: This expense category is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third-parties, primarily in the U.S., and associated transportation costs for U.S. marketing activities. The increase in 2017, compared to 2016 principally reflects the impact of higher benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes. The decrease in 2016, compared to 2015, principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices and lower volumes purchased. Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses, decreased by $401 million in 2017 compared with the prior year (2016: $197 million decrease versus 2015). The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, is due to lower workover expenses, lease operating and employee costs, partially offset by higher production taxes in the Bakken. The decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to lower production and cost reduction efforts, and lower production taxes in the Bakken. Operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the Gulf of Mexico. Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense in 2017 increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher shortfall fees in 2017. Tariffs expense in 2016 increased, compared to 2015, primarily due to increased oil gathering tariffs and shortfall fees in 2016, partially offset by lower gas volumes processed through the Tioga gas plant. For 2018, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $625 million to $650 million. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) costs decreased by $377 million in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower production and an improved portfolio average DD&A rate due to the production mix. DD&A costs decreased in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to lower production and an improved portfolio average DD&A rate due to the production mix. 30 Unit costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: Actual Forecast range 2017 2016 2015 2018 Cash operating costs $ 14.30 $ 15.56 $ 15.43 $13.00 — $14.00 Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs 24.53 26.40 28.00 18.00 — 19.00 Total Production Unit Costs $ 38.83 $ 41.96 $ 43.43 $31.00 — $33.00 Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Exploratory dry hole costs $ 268 $ 1,064 $ 410 Exploration lease and other impairment 44 145 182 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead 195 233 289 $ 507 $ 1,442 $ 881 Exploration expenses were lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower dry hole expense, leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. Exploration expenses were higher in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to higher dry hole expense partially offset by lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. See items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below. For 2018, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. Income Taxes: The E&P income tax provision was a benefit of $1,842 million in 2017 (2016: $1,587 million expense; 2015: $1,117 million benefit). Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the E&P income tax provision was an expense of $95 million in 2017 (2016: $948 million benefit; 2015: $731 million benefit). The provision in 2017 reflects higher production from Libya and lower deferred tax benefits on losses compared to the prior year. Commencing in 2017, we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia and Guyana, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. See E&P items affecting comparability of earnings below and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Income Taxes on page 41. Actual and forecast effective tax rates are as follows: Actual Forecast range 2017 2016 2015 2018 Effective income tax benefit (expense) rate 34 % -47 % 29 % N/A Adjusted effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (a) 7 % 42 % 45 % 0% - 4% (a) Excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Impairment $ (4,203 ) $ — $ (1,616 ) $ (2,250 ) $ — $ (1,566 ) Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses (280 ) (1,021 ) (518 ) (280 ) (745 ) (301 ) Gains (losses) on asset sales, net (41 ) 27 28 (57 ) 17 10 Noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars (22 ) — — (22 ) — — Income tax adjustments — — — — (2,869 ) 101 Offshore rig cost — (105 ) — — (66 ) — Inventory write-off — (39 ) (87 ) — (19 ) (58 ) Exit costs and other — (26 ) (44 ) — (17 ) (37 ) $ (4,546 ) $ (1,164 ) $ (2,237 ) $ (2,609 ) $ (3,699 ) $ (1,851 ) 31 The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) are presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income as follows: Before Income Taxes 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Sales and other operating revenues $ (22 ) $ — $ — Gains (losses) on asset sales, net (41 ) 27 28 Other, net — — (14 ) Marketing, including purchased oil and gas — — (39 ) Operating costs and expenses — (162 ) (51 ) Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment (280 ) (1,029 ) (518 ) General and administrative expenses — — (27 ) Impairment (4,203 ) — (1,616 ) $ (4,546 ) $ (1,164 ) $ (2,237 ) 2017: • Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $486 million ($486 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our assets in Equatorial Guinea, and a pre-tax gain of $330 million ($314 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin. We also incurred a pre-tax loss of $857 million ($857 million after income taxes) on the sale of our interests in Norway. The loss included the recognition in earnings of $900 million for cumulative translation adjustments previously reflected within accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 2, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Impairment: We recorded a noncash impairment charge related to our interests in Norway totaling $2,503 million pre-tax ($550 million after income taxes) in the third quarter prior to the sale of our interests in the fourth quarter. In addition, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the Stampede Field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the Tubular Bells Field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The Stampede Field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the Pony discovery prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. See Note 3, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $280 million ($280 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of our interest at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license, offshore Ghana (Hess 50% license interest) as a result of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2017 to not develop the previously discovered fields. See Note 24, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) related to certain crude oil collars not designated as cash flow hedges. The de-designation was a result of production downtime caused by a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter. 2016: • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $938 million ($693 million after income taxes) to write-off all previously capitalized wells and other project related costs for our Equus natural gas project, offshore the North West Shelf of Australia, following the decision to defer further development of the project. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $83 million ($52 million after income taxes) to write-off the previously capitalized Sicily-1 exploration well based on our decision not to pursue the project. • Gains on asset sale, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $27 million ($17 million after income taxes) related to the sale of undeveloped onshore acreage in the U.S. • Income taxes: We recorded a non-cash charge of $2,920 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. This deferred tax charge has no cash flow impact and the Corporation’s underlying tax position remains unchanged. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $51 million related to the resolution of certain international tax matters. 32 • Offshore rig cost: We recognized a pre-tax charge of $105 million ($66 million after income taxes) related to an offshore drilling rig. • Inventory write-off: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $39 million ($19 million after income taxes) to write off surplus materials and supplies inventory. • Exit costs and other: We recorded pre-tax exit and other costs of $26 million ($17 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance. 2015: • Impairment: We recorded noncash goodwill impairment charges totaling $1,483 million pre-tax ($1,483 million after income taxes), representing all goodwill of our E&P segment, due to the decline in crude oil prices. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $133 million ($83 million after income taxes) associated with our legacy conventional North Dakota assets. • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recognized a pre-tax charge of $190 million ($86 million after income taxes) to write-off an exploration well and other costs related to the Dinarta Block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq following the decision of the Corporation and its partner to relinquish the block and exit operations in the region. In offshore Ghana, we expensed previously capitalized well costs of $182 million ($117 million after income taxes) primarily associated with natural gas discoveries due to insufficient progress on appraisal negotiations with the regulator. In offshore Australia, we expensed previously capitalized well costs of $62 million ($45 million after income taxes) associated with discovered resources that we determined would not be included in the development concept for the Equus project. In addition, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $84 million ($53 million after income taxes) primarily to impair exploration leases in the Gulf of Mexico. • Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $49 million ($31 million after income taxes) related to the sale of approximately 13,000 acres of Utica dry gas acreage. We also completed the sale of our producing assets in Algeria in December 2015 and recognized a pre-tax loss of $21 million ($21 million after income taxes). • Income taxes: In 2015, we recorded net tax benefits totaling $101 million, comprised primarily of $154 million to recognize a deferred tax benefit from a legal entity restructuring, $50 million benefit from receiving approval for an international investment incentive and a $112 million charge to recognize a partial valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets. • Inventory write-off: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $48 million ($30 million after income taxes) to write off surplus drilling materials based on future drilling plans and recognized a pre-tax charge of $39 million ($28 million after income taxes) to reduce crude oil inventories to their net realizable value. • Exit costs and other: We recognized pre-tax charges totaling $21 million ($21 million after income taxes) associated with terminated international office space and incurred charges of $23 million ($16 million after income taxes) related to employee severance and other expenses. 33 Midstream Following is a summarized income statement of our Midstream operations, which include results for a gas plant and associated CO2 assets in the Permian Basin (through August 2017) and water handling assets in North Dakota that are wholly-owned by Hess: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues $ 617 $ 569 $ 634 Losses on asset sales (51 ) — — Total revenues and non-operating income 566 569 634 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses 195 218 296 General and administrative expenses 16 20 18 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 123 121 107 Impairment — 67 — Interest expense 26 19 10 Total costs and expenses 360 445 431 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes 206 124 203 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (a) 31 26 58 Net income (loss) 175 98 145 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (b) 133 56 49 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ 42 $ 42 $ 96 (a) The provision for income taxes in the Midstream segment in 2017 is presented before consolidating its operations with other U.S. activities of the Company and prior to evaluating realizability of net U.S. deferred taxes. An offsetting impact is presented in the E&P segment. (b) The partnership is not subject to tax and, therefore, the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income is a pre-tax amount. Sales and other operating revenues in 2017 increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher shortfall fees earned, and higher tariff rates and throughput volumes, partially offset by lower rail export revenue associated with third-party rail charges and the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. Total revenues and non-operating income in 2016 decreased, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of lower rail export revenue associated with third-party rail charges, partially offset by recognition of shortfall fees earned. Operating costs and expenses were lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower third-party rail charges and the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. Operating costs and expenses were lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to a decrease in third-party rail charges. DD&A expenses were higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to newly completed gathering pipelines and related facilities that were placed in service. DD&A expenses were higher in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to capital expenditures on gathering assets and railcars that were placed in service. The increase in interest expense in 2017, compared to 2016, and 2016 compared to 2015 reflects borrowings by Hess Infrastructure Partners LP. For 2018, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: We recognized a pre-tax loss of $57 million ($34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) in 2017 related to the sale of our Midstream assets in the Permian Basin. Midstream results in 2016 included a pre-tax charge of $67 million ($21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) to impair older specification rail cars. 34 Corporate, Interest and Other The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 160 $ 131 $ 219 Interest expense 385 380 376 Less: Capitalized interest (86 ) (61 ) (45 ) Interest expense, net 299 319 331 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes 459 450 550 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (26 ) (163 ) (217 ) Net Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes 433 287 333 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after-tax 30 923 44 Total Corporate, Interest and Other Expenses After Income Taxes $ 463 $ 1,210 $ 377 Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher legal costs, increased pension settlement charges in 2017, and the recognition of a nonrecurring gain of $8 million in 2016. Corporate and other expenses were lower in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily due to reductions in employee costs, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses, and the benefit of higher interest income and non-operating income. In 2018, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Interest expense was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to slightly higher average borrowings. Capitalized interest expense was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, due to increased activity at the Hess operated Stampede development project and sanction of the Liza Field Phase 1 development project during 2017. Interest expense was higher in 2016, compared to 2015, but the increase in capitalized interest expense was greater over the same period with 2016 reflecting increased activity at the Stampede development project. In 2018 after-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million as interest capitalization on the Stampede development will cease upon first production. The benefit for income taxes is lower in 2017, compared to 2016, due to us generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in the U.S. while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. This accounting treatment commenced on December 31, 2016. See items affecting comparability of earnings below and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Income Taxes on page 41. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: 2017: • Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($30 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space, of which $11 million is included in General and administrative expenses and $19 million is included in Depreciation, depletion and amortization in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 2016: • Income tax: We recorded a non-cash charge of $829 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. This deferred tax charge has no cash flow impact and the Corporation’s underlying tax position remains unchanged. • Loss on debt extinguishment: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $148 million ($92 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase and redemption of notes to complete a debt refinancing. See Note 10, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Exit costs and other: We recorded pre-tax exit and other costs of $3 million ($2 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance. 2015: • HOVENSA LLC: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $76 million ($49 million after income taxes) associated with debtor-in-possession financing provided to HOVENSA LLC and the estimated liability resulting from its bankruptcy resolution. • Other: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $20 million ($13 million after income taxes) from the sale of land and incurred exit costs of $6 million pre-tax ($4 million after income taxes). 35 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2017 2016 (In millions, except ratio) Cash and cash equivalents (a) $ 4,847 $ 2,732 Current maturities of long-term debt 580 112 Total debt (b) 6,977 6,806 Total equity 12,354 15,591 Debt to capitalization ratio (c) 36.1 % 30.4 % (a) Includes $356 million of cash attributable to Hess Infrastructure Partners (HIP), our 50/50 Midstream joint venture, at December 31, 2017 (2016: $2 million). (b) Includes $980 million of debt outstanding from HIP at December 31, 2017 (2016: $733 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. (c) Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Cash Flows From Operating Activities: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities - continuing operations $ 945 $ 795 $ 2,016 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities - discontinued operations — — (35 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 945 795 1,981 Cash Flows From Investing Activities: Additions to property, plant and equipment - E&P (1,788 ) (1,974 ) (3,952 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment - Midstream (149 ) (277 ) (369 ) Proceeds from asset sales 3,296 140 50 Other, net (1 ) 21 (44 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities - continuing operations 1,358 (2,090 ) (4,315 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities - discontinued operations — — 109 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 1,358 (2,090 ) (4,206 ) Cash Flows From Financing Activities: Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities - continuing operations (188 ) 1,311 2,497 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities - discontinued operations — — — Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (188 ) 1,311 2,497 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents - Continuing Operations 2,115 16 198 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents - Discontinued Operations — — 74 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 2,115 $ 16 $ 272 Operating Activities: In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $945 million (2016: $795 million; 2015: $1,981 million). In 2017, operating cash flows increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower production volumes. Changes in working capital in 2017 were a use of cash of $780 million and primarily related to higher accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices, abandonment expenditures, premiums on crude oil hedging contracts, pension contributions, contract termination payments for an offshore drilling rig, and crude oil delivered as line fill. In 2016, operating cash flows decreased, compared to 2015, primarily due to declining benchmark crude oil prices and changes in production volumes. Investing Activities: In 2017, Additions to property, plant and equipment were lower, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower development expenditures at North Malay Basin in the current year, partially offset by increased investments in Bakken and Guyana in 2017. The decrease in Additions to property, plant and equipment in 2016, compared to 2015, is primarily related to reduced drilling activity (Bakken, Utica, Norway, Denmark and Equatorial Guinea) and reduced development expenditures (Tubular Bells, North Malay Basin and the JDA). In 2017, proceeds from the sale of assets of $3,296 million (2016: $140 million; 2015: $50 million) related to the divestiture of our interests in Equatorial Guinea, Norway, our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin, and non-core acreage, onshore United States. 36 Financing Activities: In 2017, Hess Midstream Partners LP received proceeds of $365.5 million from the issuance of common units in an initial public offering, of which $350 million was distributed 50/50 to Hess Corporation and GIP. Borrowings for debt with maturities in excess of 90 days were $800 million in 2017 (2016: $1,496 million; 2015: $600 million), while associated repayments of debt were $459 million (2016: $1,455 million; 2015: $67 million). Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $363 million in 2017 (2016: $350 million; 2015: $287 million) and we settled the repurchase of $110 million of common stock in 2017 (2016: $-; 2015: $142 million). Net outflows to noncontrolling interests were $243 million in 2017 (2016: $23 million net outflow; 2015: $2,296 million net inflow). In 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for total net proceeds of $1.64 billion. Future Capital Requirements and Resources At December 31, 2017, Hess Corporation, had $4.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $8.9 billion. The Corporation has no significant near-term debt maturities. Net production in 2018 is forecast to be in the range of 245,000 boepd to 255,000 boepd, excluding Libya, and we expect our 2018 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.1 billion. Based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we forecast a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) in 2018. The Corporation expects to fund its 2018 net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures), reduce debt by $500 million and repurchase $380 million of common stock with existing cash and cash equivalents. On February 15, 2018, Hess Corporation redeemed $350 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due 2019 for $370 million. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2017: Letters of Expiration Credit Total Available Date Capacity Borrowings Issued Used Capacity (In millions) Revolving credit facility - Hess Corporation (a) January 2021 $ 4,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,000 Revolving credit facility - HIP (b) November 2022 600 — — — 600 Revolving credit facility - Hess Midstream Partners LP (HESM) (c) March 2021 300 — — — 300 Committed lines Various (d) 445 — 29 29 416 Uncommitted lines Various (d) 217 — 217 217 — Total $ 5,562 $ — $ 246 $ 246 $ 5,316 (a) In January 2020, the capacity reduces to $3.7 billion. (b) This credit facility may only be utilized by HIP and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. (c) This credit facility may only be utilized by HESM and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. (d) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2018. On December 1, 2017, the Corporation amended its $4.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that expires in January 2020, by extending the facility for one year to January 2021, with a $3.7 billion commitment during the extension period. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered. The facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 60% of the Corporation’s total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2017, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant. We had $246 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2017 (2016: $188 million), which primarily relate to our international operations. See also Note 23, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. In November 2017, HIP amended its senior unsecured syndicated credit facilities. At December 31, 2017, HIP has $800 million of senior secured syndicated credit facilities, consisting of a $600 million 5-year revolving credit facility and a drawn $200 million 5-year Term Loan A facility. The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to 37 fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on HIP’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). If HIP obtains an investment grade credit rating, as defined in the amended credit agreement, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as EBITDA to cash interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The amended credit agreement includes a secured leverage ratio test not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for so long as the facilities remain secured. HIP is in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2017. Outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. At December 31, 2017, HIP’s revolving credit facility was undrawn and borrowings under the Term Loan A facility amounted to $200 million, excluding deferred issuance costs. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of HIP’s and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ directly owned assets, including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries, subject to customary exclusions. Hess Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership”) has a $300 million 4-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility that became available for utilization at completion of its initial public offering in April 2017. The credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund operating activities and capital expenditures of the Partnership and expires March 2021. Borrowings on the credit facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.275%. The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the Partnership’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to EBITDA. If the Partnership obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The Partnership is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement, including financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The credit facility is secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all directly owned assets of the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including equity interests in subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exclusions. Outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. At December 31, 2017, this facility was undrawn. Credit Ratings Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt have assigned an investment grade rating. At December 31, 2017, we have investment grade credit ratings with stable outlook from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings (BBB-). Moody’s Investors Service has rated our debt at Ba1 with a stable outlook. The consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements. As of December 31, 2017, based on our current credit ratings, we may be required to issue additional collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately $135 million. If Fitch or S&P were to reduce their rating on our unsecured debt below investment grade, we estimate that we could be required to issue additional letters of credit up to approximately $240 million as of December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, HIP obtained it first credit ratings from ratings agencies. At December 31, 2017, HIP’s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service, and BB by Fitch Ratings. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2017: Payments Due by Period 2019 and 2021 and Total 2018 2020 2022 Thereafter (In millions) Total Debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 6,977 $ 580 $ 66 $ 167 $ 6,164 Operating Leases 1,310 387 506 141 276 Purchase Obligations: Capital expenditures 1,260 563 531 166 — Operating expenses 412 230 121 39 22 Transportation and related contracts 1,221 210 390 374 247 Asset retirement obligations 801 48 129 39 585 Other liabilities 668 126 117 101 324 (a) We anticipate cash payments for interest of $418 million for 2018, $800 million for 2019-2020, $765 million for 2021-2022, and $4,340 million thereafter for a total of $6,323 million. These interest payments reflect our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and, therefore, do not reflect any benefits that may arise from the previously announced $500 million debt reduction program. 38 Capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at December 31, 2017, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2018. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2017, we had $31 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable. See also Note 21, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations At December 31, 2017, we conducted E&P activities outside the U.S., principally in Africa (Libya), Asia (Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand and Malaysia), South America (Guyana and Suriname), Denmark and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, currency risk, corruption, and acts of terrorism. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E&P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year. Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2018 are at levels below that used in determining 2017 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2017 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by 39 asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2018 above those used in determining 2017 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2018 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2018 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017 would result in an approximate $200 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2018. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 81 through 91 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves. Midstream Joint Venture: On July 1, 2015, we sold a 50% interest in HIP to GIP for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion. We consolidate the activities of HIP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered HIP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between HIP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of HIP. Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. Our impairment tests of long‑lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. We could have impairment if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. As a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices, we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment. See Note 3, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process. We conduct the goodwill test at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. At December 31, 2017, our Midstream operating segment had goodwill of $360 million that resulted from an allocation from our E&P segment upon the formation of the Midstream segment in 2015. Our E&P segment has no goodwill at December 31, 2017. In step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination. The resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill were less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded. Fair value for the Midstream operating segment is based on a market approach using the exchange price of Hess Midstream Partners, LP, which is a consolidated publicly traded master limited partnership that operates substantially all of our Midstream segment assets. 40 Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year. Due to a sustained low commodity price environment, we remained in a three-year cumulative consolidated loss position as of December 31, 2017. A three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia, and Guyana, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2017, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $5,199 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth. Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E&P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long‑term rates of return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels, and participant mortality assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. The expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on 41 inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements. Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Environment, Health and Safety Our long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. We are committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions mandates and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore E&P facilities, sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2017, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $15 million in 2017 (2016: $10 million; 2015: $13 million). The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 42 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As discussed in Note 23, Financial Risk Management Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options to affect risk management activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them: • Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third-parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound, which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of British Pound at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. In 2017, we also settled forward contracts for Danish Krone. • Exchange Traded Contracts: We may use exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and have the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. Financial Risk Management Activities We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of $52 million at December 31, 2017 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $5 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, our outstanding long‑term debt of $6,977 million, including current maturities, had a fair value of $7,718 million. A 15% increase or decrease in the rate of interest would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately $500 million or $560 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we have outstanding West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil collar contracts with a notional amount of 115,000 bopd for calendar 2018 with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $65 per barrel. As of December 31, 2017, an assumed 10% increase in the forward WTI crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our crude oil collars would reduce the fair value of these derivatives instruments by approximately $120 million, while an assumed 10% decrease in the same WTI crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $70 million. See Note 23, Financial Risk Management Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) related to certain crude oil collars not designated as cash flow hedges. The de-designation was as a result of expected production downtime caused by a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico. 43 Item 8.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chief Executive Officer February 21, 2018 45 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8 and our report dated February 21, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York February 21, 2018 46 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).

Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “Hess”, “the Corporation”, “Registrant”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the consolidated business operations of Hess Corporation and its affiliates. Nature of Business: Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. The Corporation conducts exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, Suriname, Canada and in the Gulf of Mexico, including at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, where we have participated in six significant crude oil discoveries and sanctioned the first phase of a multi-phase development project at the Liza Field. The Corporation’s Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids (NGLs); gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; and storing and terminaling propane, primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. On January 1, 2017, the Corporation’s interests in a Permian Basin gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and water handling assets in North Dakota were transferred from the E&P segment to the Midstream segment as a result of organizational changes to the management of those assets. These assets were wholly-owned by the Corporation and were not included in our HIP joint venture. Prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 22, Segment Information. In the third quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of our assets in the Permian Basin. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess Corporation and entities in which we own more than a 50% voting interest. We also consolidate Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), a variable interest entity, based on our conclusion that we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. See Note 7, Hess Infrastructure Partners LP. Our undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas E&P ventures are proportionately consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned and where we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method. In 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-16, Income Taxes – Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory. This ASU requires the recognition of income tax consequences from intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The adoption of this standard was applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2017, that resulted in a decrease to Retained earnings and a decrease to Deferred income taxes, included in non-current assets, of $37 million. In 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU makes changes to various provisions associated with share-based accounting, including provisions affecting the accounting for income taxes, the accounting for forfeitures, the presentation of the statements of cash flow, and the consideration of net settlement provisions on the balance sheet classification of the share-based award. As part of the adoption of this ASU, we elected to account for forfeitures of share-based awards in the period when they occur. The effect of this election was applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2017, that resulted in a decrease to Retained earnings and an increase to Capital in excess of par value of $2 million. The cumulative effect adjustment to deferred tax assets for excess tax benefits not previously recognized as of the beginning of the period was offset by a corresponding change in valuation allowance, resulting in no cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings. Further, as part of the adoption of this ASU, we have applied its provisions affecting excess tax benefits on a prospective basis in the statement of income and the statement of cash flows, effective January 1, 2017. Estimates and Assumptions: In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves, asset and other valuations, depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes. Revenue Recognition: The E&P segment recognizes revenue from the sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas, when title passes to the customer. Differences between E&P natural gas volumes sold and our entitlement share of natural gas production are not material. 53 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In our E&P activities, we engage in crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality. These arrangements are reported net in Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Our Midstream segment recognizes revenue from fee-based services including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids, terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids, transportation of crude oil by rail car and the storage and terminaling of propane when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services rendered, price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: We record depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production facilities and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. Capitalized Interest: Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets. Impairment of Long‑lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a projected amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. As a result of the prevailing low crude oil price environment, we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment. See Note 3, Impairment. Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process. In step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired. 54 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is generally determined using average actual costs. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year. We assign cumulative historical losses significant weight in the evaluation of realizability relative to more subjective evidence such as forecasts of future income. In addition, we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We are no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to the book in excess of tax basis in the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Because of U.S. tax reform we expect that the future reversal of such temporary differences will occur free of material taxation. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. We account for the U.S. tax effect of global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries in the period that such income is earned. Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or the seabed at certain E&P locations. We initially recognize a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred, and capitalize the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long‑lived assets. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Fair value is determined by applying a credit adjusted risk-free rate to the undiscounted expected future abandonment expenditures, which represent Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy defined under Fair Value Measurements below. Retirement Plans: We recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. We recognize the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the remaining average expected life if a plan’s participants are predominantly inactive. Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments for financial risk management activities. In these activities, we may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) while the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value is recorded currently in earnings. Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by GAAP. These fair value 55 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying nonmonetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long‑lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve, but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Netting of Financial Instruments: We generally enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate legal and counterparty credit risk. Master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty, commonly known as the “safe harbor” provisions. If a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterparty’s bankruptcy, these rights are generally enforceable with respect to “safe harbor” transactions. If these arrangements provide the right of offset and our intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination, our policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis. In the normal course of business, we rely on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses providing for adequate credit assurance as well as close‑out netting, including two‑party netting and single counterparty multilateral netting. As applied to us, “two‑party netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single Hess entity, and “single counterparty multilateral netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple Hess entities. We are reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Share-based Compensation: We account for share-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting. The fair value of all share‑based compensation is recognized over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting, net of actual forfeitures. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant using a Black‑Scholes valuation model, performance share units using a Monte Carlo simulation model, and restricted stock based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. Foreign Currency Translation: The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in which business is conducted) for our foreign operations. Adjustments resulting from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. For our former operations in Norway that did not use the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency, adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in a separate component of equity titled Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) prior to the disposition. See Note 2, Dispositions. Maintenance and Repairs: Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capital improvements are recorded as additions in Property, plant and equipment. 56 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Environmental Expenditures: We accrue and expense the undiscounted environmental costs necessary to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year‑end 2017, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million. Environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment are capitalized. New Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as a new Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic, ASC 606. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Our analysis of contracts with customers against the requirements of ASC 606 is complete and we have not identified any changes to the timing of revenue recognition based on requirements of the standard that would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We will adopt ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method that requires application of the new standard prospectively from the date of adoption with a cumulative effect adjustment, if any, recorded to Retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, as a new ASC Topic, ASC 842. The new standard will require assets and liabilities to be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for all leases with lease terms greater than one year, including leases currently treated as operating leases under the existing standard. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. We have developed and are executing a project plan for the implementation of ASC 842 in the first quarter of 2019. We are progressing our assessment of existing leases and evaluating our disclosure processes with reference to the requirements of the standard. We continue to assess the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. This ASU makes changes to the impairment model for trade receivables, net investments in leases, debt securities, loans and certain other instruments. The standard requires the use of a forward-looking ""expected loss"" model compared to the current ""incurred loss"" model. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted from the first quarter of 2019. We are currently assessing the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations – Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This ASU provides a screen that excludes an integrated set of activities and assets from the definition of a business if the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. This ASU also clarifies that an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output to be considered a business. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, with early application permitted. Application of this ASU is on a prospective basis only when adopted. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU modifies the concept of goodwill impairment from a condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Thus, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The impairment charge would be limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This ASU removes the requirement to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits. This ASU requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost. The amendments also provide explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit cost in the statement of income and allow only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently assessing the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU aims to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. In addition, this ASU make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the existing hedge accounting guidance. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early application permitted. We plan to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 and expect the impact of adoption to our consolidated financial statements to be immaterial. 57 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2. Dispositions 2017: We completed the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin in August for proceeds of $597 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $273 million ($280 million attributable to Hess Corporation after income taxes and noncontrolling interest). This sale transaction included both upstream and midstream assets resulting in an after-tax gain of $314 million allocated to the E&P segment, and an after-tax loss of $34 million allocated to the Midstream segment. In November, we completed the sale of our interests in Equatorial Guinea for proceeds of $449 million, after normal closing adjustments, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $486 million ($486 million after income taxes). In December, we completed the sale of our interests in the Valhall and Hod assets, offshore Norway for proceeds of $2,056 million, after normal closing adjustments, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $857 million ($857 million after income taxes). This loss includes a recognition in earnings of $900 million for cumulative translation adjustments that were previously reflected within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Stockholders’ Equity. We also sold certain U.S. onshore assets for proceeds totaling approximately $194 million and recognized net pre-tax gains totaling $12 million ($12 million after income taxes). The 2017 asset sales of higher cost, mature assets will provide funds toward our future development projects in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, where we, and our partners, have discovered significant crude oil and natural gas resources. Pre-tax income (loss) associated with our interests in Equatorial Guinea and Norway, excluding the financial statement impacts resulting from the asset sales in 2017, were as follows for the three years ended December 31: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Equatorial Guinea (a) $ 69 $ (95 ) $ (23 ) Norway (b) (55 ) (195 ) (276 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes $ 14 $ (290 ) $ (299 ) (a) Pre-tax income for 2017 excludes the gain of $486 million related to sale of our assets in November 2017. (b) Pre-tax loss for 2017 excludes the loss of $857 million related to sale of our assets in December 2017. In addition, the 2017 loss excludes a pre-tax impairment charge of $2,503 million associated with the disposition. 2016: We sold miscellaneous non-core assets during the year for proceeds totaling approximately $100 million and recognized net pre-tax gains totaling $23 million ($14 million after income taxes). 2015: We sold approximately 13,000 acres of Utica dry gas acreage for a sale price of approximately $120 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $49 million ($31 million after income taxes). We also disposed of our interest in Algeria and recognized a pre-tax loss of $21 million ($21 million after income taxes) and sold land associated with our former joint venture interest in the Bayonne Energy Center for $20 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $20 million ($13 million after income taxes). 3. Impairment 2017: In the third quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $2,503 million ($550 million after income taxes) to impair the carrying value of our interests in Norway based on an anticipated sale of the asset, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 2, Dispositions. In the fourth quarter, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the Stampede Field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the Tubular Bells Field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The Stampede Field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the Pony discovery prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. The fourth quarter impairment charges were based on a total fair value estimate of approximately $1.1 billion that was determined using internal projected discounted cash flows. The determination of projected discounted cash flows depended on estimates of oil and gas reserves, future prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, discount rate and timing of future net cash flows. 2016: We recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $67 million ($21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) to impair older specification rail cars in our Midstream segment based on estimated salvage values, which approximated fair value. 2015: We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges totaling $1,483 million ($1,483 million after income taxes) in our E&P segment using multiple valuation methodologies. For purposes of assessing the fair value of goodwill, we considered internal projected discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects, as well as the relative market valuation of similar peer companies using market multiples, and other observable market data. Goodwill was written down to its implied fair value of zero. We also recognized an impairment charge of $133 million pre-tax ($83 million 58 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) after income taxes) relating to our legacy conventional North Dakota assets based on internal projected discounted cash flows. Each of the valuation methods used in the determination of the impairment charges above represent Level 3 fair value measurements. 4. Inventories Inventories at December 31 were as follows: 2017 2016 (In millions) Crude oil and natural gas liquids $ 59 $ 77 Materials and supplies 173 246 Total Inventories $ 232 $ 323 5. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 were as follows: 2017 2016 (In millions) Exploration and Production Unproved properties $ 520 $ 710 Proved properties 3,162 4,249 Wells, equipment and related facilities 25,550 38,250 29,232 43,209 Midstream 3,219 3,598 Corporate and Other 53 100 Total — at cost 32,504 46,907 Less: Reserves for depreciation, depletion, amortization and lease impairment 16,312 23,312 Property, Plant and Equipment — Net $ 16,192 $ 23,595 Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs: The following table discloses the amount of capitalized exploratory well costs pending determination of proved reserves at December 31, and the changes therein during the respective years: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $ 597 $ 1,415 $ 1,416 Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves 116 79 424 Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves (165 ) — (72 ) Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense (268 ) (897 ) (356 ) Dispositions and other 24 — 3 Balance at December 31 $ 304 $ 597 $ 1,415 Number of Wells at December 31 12 17 35 Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs primarily related to drilling activity at the Stabroek license offshore Guyana in 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the Gulf of Mexico in 2016 and 2015. Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves primarily related to the sanction of the first phase of Liza Field development, offshore Guyana in 2017 and Equatorial Guinea in 2015. Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense include the following: 2017: In Ghana, at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license (Hess 50% license interest), management determined in the fourth quarter of 2017 that it would not develop the previously discovered fields. As a result, we recorded a charge of $268 million to write-off previously capitalized exploration wells. See Note 24, Subsequent Events. 2016: At the Hess-operated Equus natural gas project, offshore the North West Shelf of Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, we terminated a joint front-end engineering study with a third-party natural gas liquefaction joint venture and notified the Australian government of our intent to defer the project. As a result, we expensed all well costs associated with the project, including an exploration well completed in the second quarter of 2016, totaling $830 million. These properties were 59 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) sold in 2017. In the second quarter of 2016, we expensed costs associated with two exploration wells at the non-operated Sicily project in the Gulf of Mexico where hydrocarbons were encountered but we decided not to pursue the project due to the low commodity price environment and the limited time remaining on the leases. We also expensed the cost of an unsuccessful exploration well at the non-operated Melmar project in the Gulf of Mexico, where noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons were encountered. 2015: At the Dinarta Block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, we expensed an exploration well resulting from our and our partners’ decision to cease further drilling and relinquish the block. At the Deepwater/Tano Cape Three Points block, offshore Ghana, we expensed well costs primarily related to natural gas discoveries where we were unable to sufficiently progress appraisal negotiations with the regulator. We also expensed three wells with discovered resources offshore Australia that we determined would not be included in the development concept for the Equus project. The preceding table excludes exploratory dry hole costs of $167 million in 2016 and $54 million in 2015, which were incurred and subsequently expensed in the same year. Exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling were $170 million at December 31, 2017, separated by year of completion as follows (in millions): 2016 $ — 2015 166 2014 — 2013 4 $ 170 Gulf of Mexico: Approximately 70% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the appraisal of the northern portion of the Shenzi Field (Hess 28% participating interest) in the Gulf of Mexico, where hydrocarbons were encountered in the fourth quarter of 2015. The operator is conducting appraisal activities on adjacent acreage and is evaluating plans for development of the northern portion of the Shenzi Field. JDA: Approximately 20% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess 50%) where hydrocarbons were encountered in three successful exploration wells drilled in the western part of Block A-18. The operator is currently conducting subsurface evaluations and pre-development planning to facilitate commercial negotiations with the regulator for an extension of the existing gas sales contract to include development of the western part of the block area. 6. Goodwill The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: Exploration and Production Midstream Total (In millions) Balance at December 31, 2016 $ — $ 375 $ 375 Dispositions — (15 ) (15 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 $ — $ 360 $ 360 The change in the carrying amount of goodwill relates to the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin, including a gas plant and associated CO2 assets. See Note 2, Dispositions. 7. Hess Infrastructure Partners LP On July 1, 2015, we sold a 50% interest in Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP) to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion. HIP and its affiliates primarily comprise our Midstream operating segment which provides fee-based services including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids, transportation of crude oil by rail car, terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids, and the storage and terminaling of propane, primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota. The Midstream operating segment currently generates substantially all of its revenues under long-term, fee-based agreements with our E&P operating segment and intends to pursue additional throughput volumes from third-parties in the Williston Basin area. We operate the Midstream assets and operations, including routine and emergency maintenance and repair services under various operational and administrative services agreements. 60 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The tariff agreements between our E&P operating segment and the Midstream entities became effective on January 1, 2014 and are 10-year, fee-based commercial agreements, with HIP having the sole option to renew the agreements for an additional 10-year term. These agreements include minimum volume commitments based on dedicated production, inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms. The Midstream segment has minimal direct commodity price exposure, and the E&P segment retains ownership of the crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids processed, terminaled, stored or transported by the Midstream segment. We consolidate the activities of HIP, a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and GIP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. GAAP. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power, through our 50% ownership, to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered HIP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between HIP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of HIP. As a result of the sale to GIP in 2015, we recorded an after-tax gain of $763 million in capital in excess of par value and $1,298 million in noncontrolling interest representing GIP’s proportional share of our basis in the net assets of HIP. The results attributable to GIP’s 50% ownership are reported within Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Statement of Consolidated Income, while the carrying amount of GIP’s equity is included as Noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2017, HIP liabilities totaling $1,065 million (2016: $841 million) are on a nonrecourse basis to Hess Corporation, while HIP assets available to settle the obligations of HIP included Cash and cash equivalents totaling $356 million (2016: $2 million) and Property, plant and equipment, net totaling $2,520 million (2016: $2,528 million). 8. Hess Midstream Partners LP – Initial Public Offering In April 2017, Hess Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership”), sold 16,997,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price of $23 per unit in an initial public offering (IPO) for net proceeds of $365.5 million, of which $350 million was distributed 50/50 to Hess Corporation and GIP. The Partnership owns an approximate 20% controlling interest in the operating companies that comprise our midstream joint venture, while HIP, the 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and GIP, owns the remaining 80%. Hess Corporation and GIP each own a direct 33.75% limited partner interest in the Partnership and a 50% indirect ownership interest through HIP in the Partnership’s general partner, which has a 2% economic interest in the Partnership plus incentive distribution rights. The public unit holders own a 30.5% limited partner interest in the Partnership. 9. Asset Retirement Obligations The following table describes changes to our asset retirement obligations: 2017 2016 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $ 2,128 $ 2,383 Liabilities incurred 62 42 Liabilities settled or disposed of (1,464 ) (196 ) Accretion expense 97 117 Revisions of estimated liabilities (54 ) (230 ) Foreign currency translation 32 12 Balance at December 31 801 2,128 Less: Current Obligations 48 216 Long-term Obligations at end of period $ 753 $ 1,912 The liabilities settled or disposed of primarily relate to the sale of our interests in Norway and Equatorial Guinea in 2017. The fair value of sinking fund deposits that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations, which are reported in non-current Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $118 million at December 31, 2017 (2016: $102 million). 61 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 10. Debt Long‑term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: 2017 2016 (In millions) Debt - Hess Corporation: Fixed-rate public notes: 8.1% due 2019 $ 349 $ 349 3.5% due 2024 297 297 4.3% due 2027 991 989 7.9% due 2029 500 499 7.3% due 2031 679 679 7.1% due 2033 596 596 6.0% due 2040 740 740 5.6% due 2041 1,234 1,232 5.8% due 2047 493 493 Total fixed-rate public notes 5,879 5,874 Financing obligations associated with floating production system 118 192 Fair value adjustments - interest rate hedging — 7 Total Debt - Hess Corporation $ 5,997 $ 6,073 Debt - Midstream Fixed-rate notes: 5.6% due 2026 - HIP $ 785 $ — Term loan A facility - HIP 195 580 Revolving credit facility - HIP — 153 Revolving credit facility - HESM — — Total Debt - Midstream $ 980 $ 733 Total Long-Term Debt: Total debt (a) $ 6,977 $ 6,806 Less: Current maturities of long-term debt 580 112 Total Long-Term Debt $ 6,397 $ 6,694 (a) At December 31, 2017 the fair value of total debt amounted to $7,718 million (2016: $7,548 million). At December 31, 2017, the maturity profile of total debt was as follows: Total Hess Corporation Midstream (In millions) 2018 $ 580 $ 578 $ 2 2019 51 40 11 2020 15 — 15 2021 16 — 16 2022 151 — 151 Thereafter 6,164 5,379 785 Total debt (excluding interest) $ 6,977 $ 5,997 $ 980 Debt – Hess Corporation: Fixed-rate public notes: At December 31, 2017, Hess Corporation’s fixed-rate public notes had a gross principal amount of $5,938 million (2016: $5,938 million) and a weighted average interest rate of 6.0% (2016: 6.0%). Our long‑term debt agreements, including the revolving credit facility, contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. The most restrictive of these covenants allow us to borrow up to an additional $3,352 million of secured debt at December 31, 2017. Capitalized interest was $86 million in 2017 (2016: $61 million; 2015: $45 million). 62 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In September 2016, Hess Corporation issued $1 billion of 4.30% senior notes, due in April 2027, and $500 million of 5.80% senior notes, due in April 2047 primarily to fund the repurchase of tendered higher-coupon debt and redemption of near-term maturities. We used proceeds of $1.38 billion to purchase or redeem $650 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due 2019, $196 million principal amount of 7.875% notes due 2029, $66 million principal amount of 7.30% notes due 2031 and $300 million principal amount of 1.30% notes due 2017. As a result of this debt refinancing transaction, we incurred a charge of $148 million for the loss on extinguishment of the tendered and redeemed notes. In February 2018, we purchased $350 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due 2019. See Note 24, Subsequent Events. Credit facility: In December 2017, the Corporation amended its $4 billion senior syndicated revolving credit facility by extending the facility for one year to January 2021, with a $3.7 billion commitment during the extension period. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered. The facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 60% of the Corporation’s total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2017, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit issued against the syndicated revolving credit facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant. Other outstanding letters of credit at December 31 were as follows: 2017 2016 (In millions) Committed lines (a) $ 29 $ 1 Uncommitted lines (a) 217 187 Total (b) $ 246 $ 188 (a) At December 31, 2017, committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2018. (b) At December 31, 2017, total outstanding letters of credit includes $215 million related to liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (2016: $161 million). Debt - Midstream: Our Midstream segment holds the following non-recourse debt: Hess Infrastructure Partners (HIP): In November 2017, HIP issued $800 million of 5.625% senior notes, due in February 2026 and concurrently amended its senior unsecured credit facilities. HIP used a portion of the proceeds from the note issuance to repay borrowings under HIP’s credit facilities and to fund a distribution to the partners. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes of the joint venture. Under the amended credit facilities, the 5-year Term Loan A facility was reduced to $200 million and the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility increased to $600 million from $400 million previously, with the maturity of both facilities extended to November 2022. The amended facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of HIP’s and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ directly owned assets, including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries, subject to customary exclusions. The 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility is expected to continue to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. The interest rate continues to be subject to adjustment based on the joint venture’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). If HIP obtains an investment grade credit rating, as defined in the amended credit agreement, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The joint venture is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement that include financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as EBITDA to cash interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The amended credit agreement includes a secured leverage ratio test not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for so long as the facilities remain secured. HIP is in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2017, and its financial covenants do not currently impact its ability to issue indebtedness to fund future capital expenditures. Hess Midstream Partners (the Partnership / HESM): In 2017, HESM entered into a $300 million 4-year secured syndicated revolving credit facility that can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund operating activities and capital expenditures of the Partnership. At December 31, 2017, this facility was undrawn. 63 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 11. Share-based Compensation We have established and maintain a Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP), as amended, for the granting of restricted common shares, performance share units (PSUs) and stock options to our employees. As of December 31, 2017, the total number of authorized common stock under the LTIP, as amended, was 51.5 million shares, of which we have 20.8 million shares available for issuance. Restricted stock generally vests equally on an annual basis over a three-year term while PSUs generally vest three years from the date of grant. Restricted common shares are valued based on the prevailing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options vest over three years from the date of grant, have a 10‑year term, and the exercise price equals market price on the date of grant. The number of shares of common stock to be issued under a PSU agreement is based on a comparison of the Corporation’s total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies over a three‑year performance period ending December 31 of the year prior to settlement of the grant. Payouts of the performance share awards will range from 0% to 200% of the target awards based on the Corporation’s TSR ranking within the peer group. Dividend equivalents for the performance period will accrue on performance shares, but will only be paid out on earned shares after the performance period.

The stock price volatility is determined from the historical stock prices of the peer group using the vesting period. The contractual term is equivalent to the vesting period. 12. Retirement Plans We have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a significant portion of our employees. In addition, we have an unfunded supplemental pension plan covering certain employees, which provides incremental payments that would have been payable from our principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded postretirement medical plan that provides health benefits to certain qualified retirees from ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement plans is December 31. The following table summarizes the benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of our pension and postretirement medical plans: Funded Unfunded Postretirement Pension Plans Pension Plan Medical Plan 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions) Change In Benefit Obligation Balance at January 1 $ 2,560 $ 2,321 $ 256 $ 259 $ 84 $ 98 Service cost 36 44 13 16 4 4 Interest cost 93 98 9 9 3 3 Actuarial loss (gain) (a) 138 162 10 (5 ) 3 (13 ) Benefit payments (b) (113 ) (132 ) (39 ) (23 ) (7 ) (8 ) Plan curtailments (3 ) (2 ) — — — — Special termination benefits — 1 — — — — Assumption of HOVENSA pension plan — 151 — — — — Foreign currency exchange rate changes 54 (83 ) — — — — Balance at December 31 2,765 2,560 249 256 87 84 Change In Fair Value of Plan Assets Balance at January 1 $ 2,284 $ 2,206 $ — $ — $ — $ — Actual return on plan assets 351 153 — — — — Employer contributions 158 26 39 23 7 8 Benefit payments (b) (113 ) (132 ) (39 ) (23 ) (7 ) (8 ) Assumption of HOVENSA pension plan — 126 — — — — Foreign currency exchange rate changes 52 (95 ) — — — — Balance at December 31 2,732 2,284 — — — — Funded Status (Plan assets greater (less) than benefit obligations) at December 31 $ (33 ) $ (276 ) $ (249 ) $ (256 ) $ (87 ) $ (84 ) Unrecognized Net Actuarial (Gains) Losses $ 789 $ 895 $ 84 $ 93 $ (10 ) $ (13 ) (a) The change in discount rate in 2017 resulted in total actuarial losses of approximately $170 million (2016: $175 million). (b) Benefit payments include lump-sum settlement payments of $57 million in 2017 (2016: $65 million). Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31 consisted of the following: Funded Unfunded Postretirement Pension Plans Pension Plan Medical Plan 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions) Pension asset / (accrued benefit liability) $ (33 ) $ (276 ) $ (249 ) $ (256 ) $ (87 ) $ (84 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss, pre-tax (a) 789 895 84 93 (10 ) (13 ) (a) The after‑tax deficit reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was $548 million at December 31, 2017 (2016: $660 million deficit). 65 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) At December 31, 2017, the accumulated benefit obligation for the funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans was $2,679 million and $190 million, respectively (2016: $2,471 million and $203 million, respectively). The net periodic benefit cost for funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, is as follows: Pension Plans Postretirement Medical Plan 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Service cost $ 49 $ 60 $ 67 $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 Interest cost 102 107 102 3 3 3 Expected return on plan assets (168 ) (166 ) (168 ) — — — Amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses 58 60 75 — — — Settlement loss 19 — 17 — — — Special termination benefit recognized — 1 1 — — — Net Periodic Benefit Cost $ 60 $ 62 $ 94 $ 7 $ 7 $ 7 For our pension and postretirement medical plans in 2018, service cost is estimated to be approximately $55 million, interest cost is estimated to be approximately $90 million, amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses is estimated to be approximately $50 million, and the estimated expected return on plan assets is estimated to be approximately $195 million. The weighted average actuarial assumptions used for funded and unfunded pension plans were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Weighted Average Assumptions Used to Determine Benefit Obligations at December 31 Discount rate 3.3 % 3.7 % 4.1 % Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.6 % 4.5 % Weighted Average Assumptions Used to Determine Net Periodic Benefit Cost for the Years Ended December 31 Discount rate 3.7 % 4.1 % 3.8 % Expected return on plan assets 7.3 % 7.4 % 7.5 % Rate of compensation increase 4.6 % 4.5 % 5.0 % The actuarial assumptions used for postretirement medical plan, as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Assumptions Used to Determine Benefit Obligations at December 31 Discount rate 3.2 % 3.5 % 3.5 % Initial health care trend rate 7.3 % 7.7 % 6.7 % Ultimate trend rate 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2038 2038 2038 The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year‑end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. Beginning in 2018, the Corporation has elected to use a split discount rate approach for all of its retirement plans. This involves the continued use of a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation, and separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of service cost and interest cost. In contrast, historically, a single weighted-average discount rate was used in both the calculation of the projected benefit obligation, and service cost and interest cost. This change, which is expected to decrease service cost and interest cost in 2018 by approximately $12 million before income taxes, is a change in accounting estimate that will be applied prospectively. The overall expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. Our investment strategy is to maximize long‑term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes. Asset classes and target allocations are determined by our investment committee and include domestic and foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities issued by us unless indirectly held as part of an index 66 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) strategy. The majority of plan assets are highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements. The current target allocations for plan assets are 50% equity securities, 25% fixed income securities (including cash and short‑term investment funds) and 25% to all other types of investments. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target levels. The following tables provide the fair value of the financial assets of the funded pension plans as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with the fair value measurement hierarchy described in Note 1, Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies.

(b) Primarily consists of securities issued by governmental agencies and municipalities. (c) Comprised of U.S. residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Cash and short‑term investment funds consist of cash on hand and short-term investment funds that provide for daily investments and redemptions and are valued and carried at a $1 net asset value (NAV) per fund share. Cash on hand is classified as Level 1 and short‑term investment funds are classified as Level 2. Equities consist of equity securities issued by U.S. and non‑U.S. corporations as well as commingled investment funds that invest in equity securities. Individually held equity securities, which are traded actively on exchanges and have readily available price quotes, are classified as Level 1. Commingled fund values, which are valued at the NAV per fund share derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities, are classified as Level 2. Fixed income investments consist of securities issued by the U.S. government, non‑U.S. governments, governmental agencies, municipalities and corporations, and agency and non-agency mortgage‑backed securities. This investment category 67 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) also includes commingled investment funds that invest in fixed income securities. Individual fixed income securities are generally priced on the basis of evaluated prices from independent pricing services, which are monitored and provided by the third-party custodial firm responsible for safekeeping plan assets. Individual fixed income securities are classified as Level 2 or 3. Fixed income commingled fund values, which reflect the NAV per fund share derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices in less liquid markets of the underlying securities, are classified as Level 2. Other investments consist of exchange‑traded real estate investment trust securities, as well as commingled fund and limited partnership investments in hedge funds, private equity, real estate and diversified commodities. Exchange‑traded securities are classified as Level 1. Commingled fund values reflect the NAV per fund share and are classified as Level 2 or 3. Private equity and real estate limited partnership values reflect information reported by the fund managers, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows, market based comparable data and independent appraisals from third‑party sources with professional qualifications. Hedge funds, private equity and non‑exchange‑traded real estate investments are classified as Level 3. The following tables provide changes in financial assets that are measured at fair value based on Level 3 inputs that are held by institutional funds classified as: Private Real Fixed Hedge Equity Estate Income Funds Funds Funds Total (In millions) Balance at January 1, 2016 $ 3 $ 216 $ 122 $ 52 $ 393 Actual return on plan assets — (7 ) 5 7 5 Purchases, sales or other settlements (1 ) — (1 ) (7 ) (9 ) Net transfers in (out) of Level 3 — — — — — Balance at December 31, 2016 2 209 126 52 389 Actual return on plan assets — 3 18 11 32 Purchases, sales or other settlements — (25 ) (4 ) 31 2 Net transfers in (out) of Level 3 (1 ) — — — (1 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 1 $ 187 $ 140 $ 94 $ 422 We expect to contribute approximately $44 million to our funded pension plans in 2018. Estimated future benefit payments by the funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, which reflect expected future service, are as follows (in millions): 2018 $ 127 2019 142 2020 142 2021 141 2022 145 Years 2023 to 2027 748 We also have several defined contribution plans for certain eligible employees. Employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to these plans and we match a portion of the employee contributions. We recorded expense of $22 million in 2017 for contributions to these plans (2016: $25 million; 2015: $28 million). 13. Exit and Disposal Costs In 2017, we incurred severance expense of $18 million (2016: $55 million; 2015: $13 million) and paid accrued severance costs of $48 million (2016: $52 million; 2015: $57 million). The severance expenses in 2017 resulted from certain asset disposals, as detailed in Note 2, Dispositions. In 2016 and 2015, severance charges related to a realignment of our organization structure communicated in November 2016 and a divestiture program announced in 2013, respectively. Severance charges were based on amounts incurred under ongoing severance arrangements or other statutory requirements, plus amounts earned under enhanced benefit arrangements. We recognized the expense associated with the enhanced benefits ratably over the estimated service period required for the employee to earn the benefit upon termination. In 2017, we incurred other facility and exit related costs of $14 million (2016: $-; 2015: $15 million) and settled $3 millions of these costs (2016: $2 million; 2015: $21 million). The facility and other exit costs related to charges associated with the cessation of use of certain leased office space and contract terminations. 68 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) At December 31, 2017, we had accrued liabilities for severance costs of $6 million (2016: $36 million) and accrued liabilities for exit costs of $28 million (2016: $17 million). Of the accrued liabilities at December 31, 2017, all severance costs are expected to be paid in 2018 and the exit costs will be paid over the next several years. 14.

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) United States (a) $ (2,784 ) $ (2,431 ) $ (2,728 ) Foreign (2,994 ) (1,423 ) (1,530 ) Total Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes $ (5,778 ) $ (3,854 ) $ (4,258 ) (a) Includes substantially all of our interest expense, corporate expense and the results of commodity hedging activities. The components of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets at December 31 were as follows: 2017 2016 (In millions) Deferred Tax Liabilities Property, plant and equipment and investments $ (629 ) $ (3,810 ) Other (24 ) (255 ) Total Deferred Tax Liabilities (653 ) (4,065 ) Deferred Tax Assets Net operating loss carryforwards 4,029 5,767 Tax credit carryforwards 138 164 Property, plant and equipment and investments 746 834 Accrued compensation, deferred credits and other liabilities 283 526 Asset retirement obligations 212 1,077 Other 36 62 Total Deferred Tax Assets 5,444 8,430 Valuation allowances (5,199 ) (5,450 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 245 2,980 Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) $ (408 ) $ (1,085 ) 69 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) At December 31, 2017, we have recognized a gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards of $4,029 million before application of valuation allowances. The deferred tax asset is comprised of $1,386 million attributable to foreign net operating losses which begin to expire in 2024, $2,180 million attributable to U.S. federal operating losses a portion of which begin to expire in 2028, and the majority of which begin to expire in 2034, and $463 million attributable to losses in various U.S. states which began to expire in 2018. The deferred tax asset attributable to foreign net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, is $9 million. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to U.S. federal and state net operating losses. At December 31, 2017, we have U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $53 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely, and approximately $15 million of other business credit carryforwards. The deferred tax asset attributable to these credits, net of valuation allowances, is $4 million. A full valuation allowance is established against our foreign tax credit carryforwards of $70 million, which begin to expire in 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the Balance Sheet reflects a $5,199 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on application of the relevant accounting standards. Hess continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia, and Guyana. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. The cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ending December 31, 2017 constitutes significant objective negative evidence. Such objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider subjective positive evidence, such as our projections of future taxable income, resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for these jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence. The enactment of U.S. federal tax reform, commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”), provided for broad changes to the taxation of both domestic and foreign operations. The provisions of the Act, including its extensive transition rules, are complex and interpretive guidance continues to develop. Final application of the Act to our operations and financial results may differ from that for which we have provisionally provided as of December 31, 2017. Changes could arise as regulatory and interpretive action continues to clarify aspects of the Act and as changes are made to estimates that the Corporation has utilized in calculating the transition impacts. No U.S. federal tax has been accrued on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. A decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% resulted in a $1,476 million reduction to our U.S. federal net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017, with a corresponding reduction in the previously established U.S. valuation allowance. A deferred tax liability of $110 million no longer meets the recognition criteria with the transition to a territorial regime for U.S. taxation of foreign earnings and has been derecognized, with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance against the U.S. federal net deferred tax asset. Under the transition rules related to the repeal of the alternative minimum tax regime, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of $4 million will be refundable if not used to offset regular tax liability. The previously established valuation allowance against this credit carryforward has been released. Consequently, these tax law changes resulted in a net $4 million increase to net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and benefit to deferred tax expense. In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted by taxing jurisdiction and are recorded at December 31 as follows: 2017 2016 (In millions) Deferred income taxes (long-term asset) $ 21 $ 59 Deferred income taxes (long-term liability) (429 ) (1,144 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) $ (408 ) $ (1,085 ) 70 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The difference between our effective income tax rate from continuing operations and the U.S. statutory rate is reconciled below: 2017 2016 2015 U.S. statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Effect of foreign operations (a) 17.4 4.6 5.9 State income taxes, net of Federal income tax — 1.9 0.9 Change in enacted tax laws (b) (23.6 ) (0.2 ) 0.2 Valuation allowance adjustment with tax law change (b) 23.6 — — Rate differential on U.S. impairment (4.1 ) — — Gains on asset sales, net (2.2 ) — (0.2 ) Impairment — (2.1 ) (12.2 ) Valuation allowance on current year operations (14.9 ) — — Valuation allowance against previously benefitted deferred tax assets 0.1 (97.3 ) (3.1 ) Benefit of legal entity restructuring — — 3.5 Other 0.5 0.4 0.5 Total 31.8 % (57.7 ) % 30.5 % (a) The variance in effective income tax rates attributable to the effect of foreign operations primarily resulted from the mix of income among high and low tax rate jurisdictions. (b) The enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided for a decrease in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and a change to a territorial tax regime, resulting in a net $1,366 million reduction to our U.S. net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017, with a corresponding reduction in the previously established U.S. valuation allowance. Below is a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $424 $604 $603 Additions based on tax positions taken in the current year 14 19 19 Additions based on tax positions of prior years 4 113 29 Reductions based on tax positions of prior years (147) (274) (31) Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities (85) (27) (12) Reductions due to lapses in statutes of limitation (5) (11) (4) Balance at December 31 $205 $424 $604 The December 31, 2017 balance of unrecognized tax benefits includes $30 million (2016: $233 million) that, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between $58 million and $139 million due to settlements with taxing authorities or other resolutions, as well as lapses in statutes of limitation. At December 31, 2017, our accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is $23 million (2016: $29 million). We are no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to the book in excess of tax basis in the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Because of U.S. tax reform we expect that the future reversal of such temporary differences will occur free of material taxation. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to examinations by income tax authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2005. 15. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in the Statement of Consolidated Income and the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows reflects the results of our ownership in an energy trading partnership through the date of disposal in February 2015, which was part of our former Marketing and Refining segment. 16. Common and Preferred Stock Issuance In February 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Convertible Preferred Stock), par value $1 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for total net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. The dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock are payable on a cumulative basis. Unless converted earlier, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert into between 21.822 shares 71 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) and 25.642 shares of our common stock based on the average share price over a period of twenty consecutive trading days ending prior to February 1, 2019 (the “Final Average Price”), subject to anti-dilution adjustments. See Note 17, Outstanding and Weighted Average Common Shares. We also entered into capped call transactions that are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock if the Final Average Price exceeds $45.83 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The number of common shares to be delivered by the counterparties to us will be the value of the capped call transactions at conversion divided by the Final Average Price. The value of the capped call transactions will be zero if the Final Average Price is $45.83 or less and can be up to the capped value of approximately $98 million if the Final Average Price is $53.625 or higher. For any Final Average Price between $45.83 and $53.625, the value of the capped call transactions will be 12.55 million covered shares multiplied by the difference between the Final Average Price and $45.83. The premium paid for the capped call transactions was $37 million, which was recorded against Capital in excess of par in the Statement of Consolidated Equity. 17.

Leased Assets We and certain of our subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, office space and other assets for varying periods under contractual obligations accounted for as operating leases. Operating lease expenses for drilling rigs used to drill development wells and successful exploration wells are capitalized. At December 31, 2017, future minimum rental payments applicable to non‑cancelable operating leases with remaining terms of one year or more (other than oil and gas property leases) are as follows (in millions): 2018 $ 387 2019 376 2020 130 2021 71 2022 70 Remaining years 276 Total Minimum Lease Payments 1,310 Less: Income from subleases 99 Net Minimum Lease Payments $ 1,211 Rental expense was as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Total rental expense $ 123 $ 106 $ 167 Less: Income from subleases 10 5 10 Net Rental Expense $ 113 $ 101 $ 157 21. Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments Guarantees and Contingencies At December 31, 2017, we have $31 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable. In addition, we are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through lengthy discovery, conciliation and/or arbitration proceedings, or litigation before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters described below, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are four remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state, have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been removed to Federal court and has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. The suit filed in Vermont is proceeding there in a state court. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Rhode Island is proceeding in Federal court. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other 74 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Maryland was filed in state court, but has not been served to date. In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and also agreed with EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because there are numerous other parties who we expect will share in the cost of remediation and damages and our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length. In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. The remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. EPA has estimated that this remedy will cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected ship-building and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. We indicated to EPA that we would comply with the Administrative Order and are currently contributing funding for the Remedial Design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties. At the same time, we are participating in an allocation process whereby a neutral expert selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the Remedial Design costs to be paid by each of the participants. On September 28, 2017, we received a general notice letter and offer to settle from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency relating to Superfund claims for the Ector Drum, Inc. Superfund Site in Odessa, TX. The EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) took clean-up and response action at the site commencing in 2014 and concluded in December 2015. The site was determined to have improperly stored industrial waste, including drums with oily liquids. The total clean-up cost incurred by the EPA was approximately $3.5 million. We were invited to negotiate a voluntary settlement for our purported share of the clean-up costs. Our share, if any, is undetermined. From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of the aforementioned proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments The following table shows aggregate information for certain unconditional purchase obligations and commitments at December 31, 2017, which are not included elsewhere within these Consolidated Financial Statements: Payments Due by Period 2019 and 2021 and Total 2018 2020 2022 Thereafter (In millions) Capital expenditures $ 1,260 $ 563 $ 531 $ 166 $ — Operating expenses 412 230 121 39 22 Transportation and related contracts 1,221 210 390 374 247 75 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 22. Segment Information We currently have two operating segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Midstream. The E&P operating segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases and sells crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Production operations over the three years ended December 31, 2017 were primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the JDA and Malaysia, and from divested assets, including Equatorial Guinea and Norway. The Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids, transportation of crude oil by rail car, terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids, and the storage and terminaling of propane, primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota. All unallocated costs are reflected under Corporate, Interest and Other.

Financial Risk Management Activities In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, corporate financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. We maintain a control environment for all of our financial risk management activities under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Corporate Financial Risk Management Activities: Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas we produced or by reducing our exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to fix the forward selling price of a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we conduct the business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. At December 31, 2017, these forward contracts relate to the British Pound. Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates and, in the case of certain long-term debt relating to our Midstream operating segment, from floating to fixed rates. Gross notional amounts of both long and short positions are presented in the volume tables beginning below. These amounts include long and short positions that offset in closed positions and have not reached contractual maturity. Gross notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but are used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts. 77 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The gross notional amounts of financial risk management derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, were as follows: 2017 2016 (In millions) Commodity - crude oil (millions of barrels) 42 — Foreign exchange $ 52 $ 785 Interest rate swaps $ 450 $ 350 At December 31, 2017, we have outstanding West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil collar contracts with a notional amount of 115,000 bopd for 2018 with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $65 per barrel. Contracts with a notional amount of 90,000 bopd are designated as cash flow hedges, while 25,000 bopd were de-designated as cash flow hedges following the shutdown of a third-party operated offshore platform as a result of a fire in the fourth quarter of 2017. The table below reflects the gross and net fair values of the risk management derivative instruments, all of which are based on Level 2 inputs: Assets Liabilities (In millions) December 31, 2017 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments Commodity - Accounts payable $ — $ (7 ) Interest rate - Other assets (noncurrent) and Accounts payable — (4 ) Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments — (11 ) Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Commodity - Accounts payable — (2 ) Foreign exchange 1 — Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments 1 (2 ) Gross fair value of derivative contracts 1 (13 ) Net Fair Value of Derivative Contracts $ 1 $ (13 ) December 31, 2016 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments Interest rate $ — $ — Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments — — Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange - Accounts receivable and Accrued liabilities 9 (1 ) Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments 9 (1 ) Gross fair value of derivative contracts 9 (1 ) Master netting arrangements (1 ) 1 Net Fair Value of Derivative Contracts $ 8 $ — Income statement impact of derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments: Crude oil collars: In 2017, crude oil price hedging contracts decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $34 million (2016: $-; 2015: increase of $126 million). This amount includes a loss of $71 million associated with changes in the time value of crude oil collars (2016: $-; 2015: losses of $48 million), and a charge of $1 million for hedge ineffectiveness (2016: $-; 2015: $-). At December 31, 2017, after-tax deferred losses in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to outstanding hedged crude oil collars were $127 million, of which all will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings. There were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: At December 31, 2017, we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $450 million (2016: $350 million), which were designated as fair value hedges and relate to debt where we have converted interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates. During 2016, we settled existing interest rate swaps and received cash proceeds of $5 million (2015: $41 million). Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and the hedged fixed‑rate debt are recorded in Interest expense in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2017, the change in fair value of interest rate swaps was an increase in the derivative liability of $4 million (2016: $6 million increase in asset; 2015: $4 million increase in asset) with a corresponding adjustment in the carrying value of the hedged fixed‑rate debt. In February 2018, we terminated interest rate swaps with a gross notional amount of $350 million. See Note 24, Subsequent Events. 78 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges: At December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. During 2017, HIP entered into interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts totaling $553 million to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from floating to fixed rates before settling these instruments as part of the refinancing that occurred later in the year. See Note 10, Debt. In 2017, the change in fair value of interest rate swaps was an increase to assets of $3 million and the cash settlement was $3 million. At December 31, 2017, after-tax deferred income in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in connection with the settled instruments, was $1 million, of which all will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. Income statement impact of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments: Crude oil collars: In 2017, noncash adjustments to de-designated crude oil price hedging contracts decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $25 million. At December 31, 2017, after-tax deferred losses in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in connection with the de-designation, were $12 million, of which all will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the originally hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings. Foreign exchange: Total foreign exchange gains and losses were a gain of $15 million in 2017 (2016: gain of $26 million; 2015: loss of $21 million) and are reported in Other, net in Revenues and non-operating income in the Statement of Consolidated Income. A component of foreign exchange gains or losses is the result of foreign exchange derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges which amounted to a gain of $3 million in 2017 (2016: gain of $62 million; 2015: gain of $98 million). In 2017, after‑tax foreign currency translation adjustments included in the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income amounted to a gain of $144 million (2016: gain of $56 million; 2015: loss of $344 million) and $900 million of cumulative currency translation losses that were recognized in earnings as a result of the sale of our assets in Norway. See Note 2, Dispositions. Cumulative currency translation adjustments reduced stockholders’ equity by $1,044 million at December 31, 2016. Credit Risk: We are exposed to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, groups of counterparties or customers. Accounts receivable are generated from a diverse domestic and international customer base. As of December 31, 2017, our Accounts receivable—Trade were concentrated with the following counterparty industry segments: Integrated companies — 50%, Refining and marketing companies — 17%, Independent E&P companies — 14%, Storage and transportation companies — 7%, National oil companies — 2% and Others — 10%. We reduce risk related to certain counterparties, where applicable, by using master netting arrangements and requiring collateral, generally cash or letters of credit. At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $246 million (2016: $188 million). Fair Value Measurement: We have other short-term financial instruments, primarily cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, for which the carrying value approximated fair value at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. In addition, the disclosure for fair value of long-term debt in Note 10, Debt was based on Level 2 inputs. 24. Subsequent Events In January 2018, we eliminated approximately 300 employee positions as part of a cost reduction program following the 2017 asset sales. We expect to record employee severance costs of $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter of 2018. On February 15, 2018, Hess Corporation redeemed $350 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due 2019 for $370 million. The carrying value of these notes, which are included in Current maturities of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $349 million at December 31, 2017. Concurrent with the redemption, the Corporation terminated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $350 million, which were previously designated as fair value hedges of these notes. On February 16, 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in Ghana for total consideration of $100 million, consisting of a $25 million payment upon closing and a further payment of $75 million payable upon approval of the Plan of Development on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block. The transaction is subject to government approval and customary closing conditions. 79 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DATA (UNAUDITED) The Supplementary Oil and Gas Data that follows is presented in accordance with ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities, and includes (1) costs incurred, capitalized costs and results of operations relating to oil and gas producing activities, (2) net proved oil and gas reserves and (3) a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves, including a reconciliation of changes therein.

Proved oil and gas reserves are quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by our internal teams of geoscience and reservoir engineering professionals. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007).” The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir, the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate, the stage of reservoir development and the production history. Where applicable, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC regulations. These technologies, including computational methods, must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In order for reserves to be classified as proved, any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project, either senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the development. Our proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10‑K. Internal Controls The Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation processes, which are administered by the Corporation’s Director, Global Reserves and its Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff who work directly with the oil and gas properties using standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates for a selection of the Corporation’s assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an independent third-party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves (see pages 84 through 89). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors. Qualifications The person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves during 2017 was Mr. David DuBois, Director Global Reserves. Mr. DuBois is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has over 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a BS degree in Petroleum Engineering. His experience has been primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas. Mr. DuBois is responsible for the Corporation’s Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization responsible for establishing the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews. Reserves Audit We engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 80% of 2017 year‑end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (2016: 78%). The purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D&M letter report, dated February 7, 2018, on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry. D&M is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. D&M’s letter report on the Corporation’s December 31, 2017 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this Form 10‑K. While the D&M report should be read in 82 its entirety, the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M, the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and audited by D&M, in the aggregate, differed by 4% (2016: 3%) of total audited net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The report also includes among other information, the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve audit. Crude Oil Prices Used to Estimate Proved Reserves Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period before December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were $51.19 per barrel for WTI (2016: $42.68; 2015: $50.13) and $54.87 per barrel for Brent (2016: $44.45; 2015: $55.10). New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were $3.03 per mcf in 2017 (2016: $2.54; 2015: $2.63). At December 31, 2017, spot prices for WTI oil closed at $60.42 per barrel. If crude oil prices during 2018 average below those used in determining 2017 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our proved undeveloped reserves or to our proved developed reserves at December 31, 2018, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, if crude oil prices in 2018 remain above those used in determining 2017 proved reserves, we could recognize positive revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2018. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential negative or positive change in proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2018 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2018 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. 83 Following are the Corporation’s proved reserves: Crude Oil & Condensate Natural Gas Liquids United States Europe (b) Africa Asia & Other Total United States Europe (b) Asia & Other Total (Millions of bbls) (Millions of bbls) Net Proved Reserves At January 1, 2015 512 265 188 7 972 119 26 — 145 Revisions of previous estimates (a) (157 ) (54 ) 9 (1 ) (203 ) (42 ) — — (42 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 45 6 1 — 52 11 1 — 12 Sales of minerals in place — — (8 ) — (8 ) — — — — Production (54 ) (14 ) (18 ) (1 ) (87 ) (14 ) — — (14 ) At December 31, 2015 346 203 172 5 726 74 27 — 101 Revisions of previous estimates (a) 42 (14 ) 2 1 31 23 (19 ) — 4 Extensions, discoveries and other additions 12 33 — — 45 5 — — 5 Sales of minerals in place — — — — — — — — — Production (45 ) (12 ) (12 ) (1 ) (70 ) (16 ) — — (16 ) At December 31, 2016 355 210 162 5 732 86 8 — 94 Revisions of previous estimates (a) 13 5 (6 ) — 12 56 — — 56 Extensions, discoveries and other additions 127 2 — 45 174 50 — — 50 Sales of minerals in place (21 ) (158 ) (15 ) — (194 ) (6 ) (8 ) — (14 ) Production (41 ) (10 ) (13 ) (1 ) (65 ) (15 ) — — (15 ) At December 31, 2017 433 49 128 49 659 171 — — 171 Net Proved Developed Reserves At January 1, 2015 264 114 163 3 544 56 9 — 65 At December 31, 2015 253 114 148 5 520 51 12 — 63 At December 31, 2016 245 116 138 5 504 59 3 — 62 At December 31, 2017 239 45 112 5 401 87 — — 87 Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 1, 2015 248 151 25 4 428 63 17 — 80 At December 31, 2015 93 89 24 — 206 23 15 — 38 At December 31, 2016 110 94 24 — 228 27 5 — 32 At December 31, 2017 194 4 16 44 258 84 — — 84 (a) For crude oil and condensate reserves, there was no significant impact of changes in selling prices on the reserve estimates for production sharing contracts with cost recovery provisions in 2017 (2016: 1 million barrels increase; 2015: 5 million barrels increase).

Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota and in the North Malay Basin. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 280 million boe (170 million barrels of crude oil, 49 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 365 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 87. 2016: Total Additions were 69 million boe, of which 45 million boe (34 million barrels of crude oil, 2 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 55 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota and from a 20-year extension to the license for the South Arne Field, offshore Denmark, which extends expiry to 2047. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 24 million boe (11 million barrels of crude oil, 3 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 59 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 87. 2015: Total Additions were 82 million boe, of which 33 million boe (19 million barrels of crude oil, 5 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 54 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota and the Utica shale play in Ohio. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 49 million boe (33 million barrels of crude oil, 7 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 56 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 87. Revisions of previous estimates 2017: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net increase of 106 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 126 million boe (41 million barrels of crude oil, 44 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 243 million mcf of natural gas). Revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken amounted to 85 million boe with approximately 55% resulting from improved reservoir performance, and the remaining 45% resulting from higher prices and an improved cost structure. The Gulf of Mexico and Utica had positive revisions to proved developed reserves totaling 16 million boe due to improved reservoir performance, while higher crude oil prices resulted in revisions to proved developed reserves of 15 million boe in Denmark and Utica. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 87. 2016: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net increase of 74 million boe, of which net positive revisions increased proved reserves by 103 million boe (54 million barrels of crude oil, 5 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 265 million mcf of natural gas) and negative revisions associated with lower crude oil prices reduced proved reserves by 29 million boe (23 million barrels of crude oil, 1 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 30 million mcf of natural gas). Total revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 41 million boe (5 million barrels decrease of crude oil, 7 million barrels increase of natural gas liquids and 235 million mcf increase of natural gas) reflecting improved expected recoveries in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota, completion of incremental development activities at the North Malay Basin, partially offset by negative revisions at the Valhall Field offshore Norway due to changes in estimated recoveries of natural gas liquids and natural gas, and negative price revisions mostly related to crude oil reserves. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 87. 2015: Total revisions of previous estimates were a net decrease of 280 million boe. Negative revisions associated with lower crude oil prices reduced proved reserves at December 31, 2015 by 234 million boe (158 million barrels of crude oil, 26 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 299 million mcf of natural gas), including 220 million boe (147 million barrels of crude oil, 22 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 303 million mcf of natural gas) associated with proved undeveloped reserves. Other net negative revisions were 46 million boe, which also primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves that are discussed in further detail on page 87. Sales of minerals in place (‘Asset sales’) 2017: Assets sales primarily include our interests in Norway, Equatorial Guinea, and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin. 86 Proved Undeveloped Reserves Following are the Corporation’s proved undeveloped reserves: United States Europe Africa Asia & Other Total (Millions of boe) Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 1, 2015 356 189 27 97 669 Revisions of previous estimates (203 ) (57 ) (1 ) (31 ) (292 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 42 7 — — 49 Transfers to proved developed reserves (56 ) (17 ) — (62 ) (135 ) Sales of minerals in place — — — — — At December 31, 2015 139 122 26 4 291 Revisions of previous estimates 50 (14 ) — (3 ) 33 Extensions, discoveries and other additions 13 11 — — 24 Transfers to proved developed reserves (34 ) (4 ) — — (38 ) Sales of minerals in place — — — — — At December 31, 2016 168 115 26 1 310 Revisions of previous estimates (8 ) (3 ) (9 ) — (20 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 209 3 — 68 280 Transfers to proved developed reserves (32 ) — — — (32 ) Sales of minerals in place — (109 ) — — (109 ) At December 31, 2017 337 6 17 69 429 Extensions, discoveries and other additions (‘Additions’) 2017: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 180 million boe, of which approximately 70% resulted from higher crude oil prices that increased the percentage of proved undeveloped wells in our planned five-year drilling program compared to the prior year. The remaining 30% of Bakken additions reflect the expected improved recovery in future wells from changes in well completion design and reservoir performance. Additions from the Stampede Field in the Gulf of Mexico were 21 million boe, due to completion of further development activities. At the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, additions of 45 million boe were recognized for project sanction of the first phase of the Liza Field development. Other international additions were primarily at North Malay Basin due to higher prices. 2016: In the United States, additions were at the Utica shale play in Ohio as result of changes in well design that improved both well economics and recoverability, and at the Bakken shale play in North Dakota due to drilling plans. In Europe, additions were primarily from a 20-year extension to the license for the South Arne Field, offshore Denmark, which extends expiry to 2047. 2015: In the United States, we recognized additions of 29 million boe in the Bakken shale play and 13 million boe related to the Tubular Bells and Penn State Fields in the Gulf of Mexico based on drilling plans for new wells. Revisions of previous estimates 2017: Total negative reserve revisions of 20 million boe, primarily relate to changes in drilling plans in Libya and lower reserves at certain fields in the Gulf of Mexico and Denmark. 2016: Total positive reserve revisions were 33 million boe. Technical revisions increased reserves by 44 million boe and were primarily from an improved well design at the Bakken shale play in North Dakota, which was partially offset by negative revisions at the Valhall Field offshore Norway due to changes in expected recoveries of natural gas liquids and natural gas. Negative revisions resulting from lower commodity prices totaled 11 million boe and were primarily in the Bakken shale play. 2015: Total negative reserve revisions were 292 million boe. Negative revisions resulting from lower commodity prices totaled 220 million boe, and were primarily in the Bakken shale play (127 million boe), the North Malay Basin offshore Malaysia (34 million boe), the Valhall Field offshore Norway (30 million boe) and the Stampede project in the Gulf of Mexico (21 million boe). Other negative revisions included 48 million boe related to planned drilling dates of certain Bakken wells moving beyond 2020 due to reprioritization of the drilling schedule, and 26 million boe at the Valhall Field offshore Norway primarily related to drilling schedule changes. 87 Transfers to proved developed reserves (‘Transfers’) 2017: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 24 million boe in the Bakken shale play and 8 million boe at the Penn State Field in the Gulf of Mexico associated with drilling activity. 2016: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 21 million boe in the Bakken shale play and 13 million boe at the Tubular Bells and Conger Fields in the Gulf of Mexico associated with drilling activity. 2015: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 43 million boe in the Bakken shale play and 11 million boe at the Valhall Field offshore Norway associated with drilling activity. Transfers of 61 million boe related to Block A-18 in the Gulf of Thailand primarily resulted from additional development and drilling activity. In 2017, capital expenditures of $527 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (2016: $589 million; 2015: $1,931 million). Projects that have proved reserves, which have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess of five years, total 14 million boe, or 1% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2017. Most of the proved undeveloped reserves in excess of five years relate to Libya. Production Sharing Contracts The Corporation’s proved reserves include crude oil and natural gas reserves relating to long‑term agreements with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the legal right to produce or has a revenue interest in the production. Proved reserves from these production sharing contracts for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017 are presented separately below, as well as volumes produced and received during 2017, 2016 and 2015 from these production sharing contracts.

No proved reserves were recorded for Guyana in prior years. Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves Future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining year‑end reserve estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development and production costs, which are based on year‑end costs and existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year‑end statutory tax rates to the pre‑tax net cash flows, as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%. The prices used for the discounted future net cash flows in 2017 were $51.19 per barrel for WTI (2016: $42.68; 2015: $50.13) and $54.87 per barrel for Brent (2016: $44.45; 2015: $55.10). New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were $3.03 per mcf in 2017 (2016: $2.54; 2015: $2.63) and do not include the effects of commodity hedges. Selling prices have in the past, and can in the future, fluctuate significantly. As a result, selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices. In addition, the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The amount of tax deductions, credits, and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves, variances in actual pre-tax cash flows from forecasted pre-tax cash flows in historical periods, and the impact to year-end carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the Corporation’s income tax returns exploration expenses, interest expense, and corporate general and administrative expenses 88 that are not contemplated in the standardized measure computations. The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used.

Due to the low crude oil price used in the 2016 computation, future income taxes reflect cash inflows for Norway of $2.1 billion on an undiscounted basis. The corresponding present value reflected in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at December 31, 2016 is $70 million. 89 Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves For the Years Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at January 1 $ 4,025 $ 7,190 $ 17,002 Changes during the year Sales and transfers of oil and gas produced during the year, net of production costs (2,216 ) (1,368 ) (2,803 ) Development costs incurred during the year 1,679 1,369 3,394 Net changes in prices and production costs applicable to future production 2,330 (4,284 ) (20,236 ) Net change in estimated future development costs (568 ) (76 ) 5,116 Extensions and discoveries (including improved recovery) of oil and gas reserves, less related costs 1,282 338 530 Revisions of previous oil and gas reserve estimates 644 376 (1,274 ) Net purchases (sales) of minerals in place, before income taxes 116 — (18 ) Accretion of discount 603 779 2,799 Net change in income taxes (709 ) 1,331 7,601 Revision in rate or timing of future production and other changes (830 ) (1,630 ) (4,921 ) Total 2,331 (3,165 ) (9,812 ) Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at December 31 $ 6,356 $ 4,025 $ 7,190 90 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED) Following are quarterly results of operations: 2017 FirstQuarter SecondQuarter ThirdQuarter FourthQuarter (In millions, except per share amounts) Sales and other operating revenues $ 1,258 $ 1,197 $ 1,348 $ 1,663 Gross profit (loss) from continuing operations (a) $ (69 ) $ (202 ) $ (2,631 ) $ (1,549 ) Net income (loss) (296 ) (417 ) (593 ) (2,635 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 28 32 31 42 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation (324 ) (449 ) (624 ) (2,677 ) Less: Preferred stock dividends 12 11 11 12 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation common stockholders $ (336 ) $ (460 ) $ (635 )(b) $ (2,689 )(c) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation per common share: Basic $ (1.07 ) $ (1.46 ) $ (2.02 ) $ (8.57 ) Diluted $ (1.07 ) $ (1.46 ) $ (2.02 ) $ (8.57 ) 2016 FirstQuarter SecondQuarter ThirdQuarter FourthQuarter (In millions, except per share amounts) Sales and other operating revenues $ 973 $ 1,224 $ 1,177 $ 1,388 Gross profit (loss) from continuing operations (a) $ (539 ) $ (333 ) $ (304 ) $ (417 ) Net income (loss) (488 ) (373 ) (317 ) (4,898 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 21 19 22 (6 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation (509 ) (392 ) (339 ) (4,892 ) Less: Preferred stock dividends 6 12 12 11 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation common stockholders $ (515 ) $ (404 )(d) $ (351 ) $ (4,903 )(e) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation per common share: Basic $ (1.72 ) $ (1.29 ) $ (1.12 ) $ (15.65 ) Diluted $ (1.72 ) $ (1.29 ) $ (1.12 ) $ (15.65 ) (a) Gross profit represents Sales and other operating revenues, less Marketing expenses, Operating costs and expenses, Production and severance taxes, Depreciation, depletion and amortization and Impairment.

Risk Factors Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below. These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, liquidity, financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, and our associated realized price differentials, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of OPEC, may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets. Other factors include, but are not limited to: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, armed conflict or economic sanctions) around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions, the cost of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally. The sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Average prices for 2018 were $64.90 per barrel for WTI (2017: $50.85; 2016: $43.47) and $71.69 per barrel for Brent (2017: $54.74; 2016: $45.13). In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain significant bank credit facilities. An inability to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves, which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions, which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Similar risks, however, may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. In addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement, replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. Crude oil prices declined in 2016, relative to preceding years, resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves. In contrast, crude oil prices improved somewhat in 2017 and 2018 resulting in increases to our reported proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2019 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2018, it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and on the value of our business. See Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, 14 parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel, the imposition of tariffs, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations and financial results. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political instability and civil unrest in North Africa, South America and the Middle East has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. In addition, geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas, such as the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over a portion of the Stabroek Block. Political instability exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals, enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks has 15 resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, in 2017 certain municipalities and private associations in California, Rhode Island, and Maryland separately filed lawsuits against over 30 fossil fuel producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources and more diverse portfolios than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. To a lesser extent, we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, including wind, solar and electric power, and in the future, could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources to acquire and develop oil and gas assets. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Many of our competitors have a more diverse portfolio of assets, which may minimize the impact of adverse events occurring at any one location. Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‑made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic events include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‑attacks. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent, including for property and casualty losses. There can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. As part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures. This may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows. Departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. Our future success depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy. The departure of key members of senior management or an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. An inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost. These consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. We manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into additional commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons, we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility. One of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, Hess Midstream Partners LP. The responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities. Our control of Hess Midstream Partners LP bestows upon us additional fiduciary duties including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests, additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the provision of tax information to unit holders of Hess Midstream Partners LP. These heightened 16 duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders. Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs. Disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the Company may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, a disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, financial loss, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are three remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Rhode Island is proceeding in Federal court. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to Federal court by the defendants. In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and also agreed with EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the Federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs 17 cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages. In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. The remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. EPA has estimated that this remedy will cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected ship-building and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. We indicated to EPA that we would comply with the Administrative Order and are currently contributing funding for the Remedial Design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties. At the same time, we are participating in an allocation process whereby a neutral expert selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the Remedial Design costs to be paid by each of the participants. On September 28, 2017, we received a general notice letter and offer to settle from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency relating to Superfund claims for the Ector Drum, Inc. Superfund Site in Odessa, Texas. The EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) took clean-up and response action at the site commencing in 2014 and concluded in December 2015. The site was determined to have improperly stored industrial waste, including drums with oily liquids. The total clean-up cost incurred by the EPA was approximately $3.5 million. We were invited to negotiate a voluntary settlement for our purported share of the clean-up costs. Our share, if any, is undetermined. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, such as those discussed above, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, the EPA’s claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of the aforementioned proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8, the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. Index Overview Consolidated Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, Suriname, Canada and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we have participated in twelve significant discoveries. The Liza Phase 1 development was sanctioned in 2017 and is expected to startup in early 2020 with production reaching up to 120,000 gross bopd. The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin the potential for at least five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2025. Our Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGLs; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. In 2018, we completed the sale of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio, onshore U.S., and during 2017 we sold our interests in Equatorial Guinea, Norway and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin, onshore U.S. These sales, which generated total proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, are consistent with our strategy to high grade our portfolio by divesting lower return, mature assets to invest in higher return assets, primarily in Guyana and the Bakken, and to provide returns to shareholders. During 2018, we repurchased $1.38 billion of common stock (2017: $120 million), repaid debt of $633 million, and paid dividends of $345 million. At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 billion excluding Midstream. Outlook We project our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.9 billion in 2019. Capital investment for our Midstream operations is expected to be approximately $330 million. Oil and gas production in 2019 is forecast to be in the range of 270,000 boepd to 280,000 boepd excluding Libya, up from 248,000 boepd in 2018, excluding Libya and assets sold. We have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a WTI monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 95,000 bopd. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,939 million in 2018, compared to $945 million in 2017, while capital expenditures for 2018 and 2017 were $2,180 million and $1,973 million, respectively. Based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2019, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2018 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends through the end of 2019. Consolidated Results Net loss attributable to Hess Corporation was $282 million in 2018 (2017: $4,074 million; 2016: $6,132 million). Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 26, the adjusted net loss was $176 million in 2018 (2017: $1,401 million; 2016: $1,489 million). Annual production averaged 277,000 boepd in 2018 (2017: 306,000 boepd; 2016: 322,000 boepd). Total proved reserves were 1,192 million boe at December 31, 2018 (2017: 1,154 million boe; 2016: 1,109 million boe). 22 Significant 2018 Activities The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2018: Producing E&P assets: • In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged 117,000 boepd (2017: 105,000 boepd). During 2018, we operated an average of 4.8 rigs, drilled 121 wells, completed 118 wells, and brought on production 104 wells. During 2018, we transitioned from utilizing sliding sleeve completion designs to plug and perf completions. During 2019, we plan to operate six rigs, drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 160 wells on production. From 2019, all production wells will use plug and perf completions, which we expect will allow us to increase peak net production to approximately 200,000 boepd by 2021. We forecast net production for full year 2019 to be in the range of 135,000 boepd to 145,000 boepd. • In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 57,000 boepd (2017: 54,000 boepd). The increase in production was primarily due to the Stampede and Penn State Fields, partially offset by the impact of downtime from a planned well workover at the Tubular Bells Field, the shutdown at the third-party operated Enchilada platform, and natural field decline. We forecast Gulf of Mexico net production for full year 2019 to be in the range of 65,000 boepd to 70,000 boepd. • In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A‑18 of the JDA averaged 36,000 boepd for the year (2017: 37,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, while net production from North Malay Basin averaged 27,000 boepd for the year (2017: 11,000 boepd). Production from the North Malay Basin full-field development project commenced in July 2017. During 2018 we drilled three production wells at North Malay Basin, and plan to continue the drilling program and development activities in 2019. We forecast Gulf of Thailand net production for full year 2019 to be in the range of 60,000 boepd and 65,000 boepd. • In Denmark, we announced that we decided to retain our interest in the Hess operated offshore South Arne Field after offers received in a previously announced sale process did not meet our value expectations. During 2019, we plan to drill an exploration well on License 06/16, located approximately 19 miles from South Arne. Other E&P assets: • Offshore Guyana, at the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited progressed the first phase of the Liza Field development, which was sanctioned in 2017. The Liza Phase 1 development, which is expected to begin producing oil by early 2020 will use the Liza Destiny FPSO to produce up to 120,000 gross bopd. Drilling of development wells in the Liza Field is continuing, subsea equipment is being prepared for installation, and the topside facilities modules have been installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO in Singapore, which is expected to arrive offshore Guyana in the third quarter of 2019. Preparations are also underway for the installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines at the Liza Field in the spring of 2019. Phase 2 of the Liza Field development is expected to start production by mid-2022. Pending government and regulatory approvals, project sanction for Phase 2 is expected by the operator in the first quarter of 2019 and will include a second FPSO vessel designed to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd. Project sanction for a third phase of development at the Payara Field is expected in 2019 with first production expected to start up as early as 2023. In addition to the first three phases, development planning is underway for additional FPSOs. The ultimate sizing and timing will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling. The operator is currently utilizing three drillships on the block. The Stena Carron and the Noble Tom Madden, which arrived in the third quarter of 2018, are involved in exploration and appraisal drilling. The Noble Bob Douglas is drilling development wells for Liza Phase 1. In 2018, the following explorations wells were drilled on the Stabroek Block (in chronological order): Ranger-1: The well, located approximately 60 miles northwest of the Liza discovery, encountered approximately 230 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. Pacora-1: The well encountered approximately 65 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir, and is located approximately four miles west of the Payara-1 well, which was drilled in 2017. The operator plans to integrate this discovery into the Payara Field development. Liza-5: The well encountered 77 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately six miles northwest of the Liza-1 well, which was drilled in 2016. 23 Sorubim-1: The well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Longtail-1: The well encountered approximately 256 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately five miles west of the Turbot-1 well, which was drilled in 2017. Hammerhead-1: The well encountered approximately 197 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 13 miles to the southwest of the Liza-1 well. Pluma-1: The well encountered approximately 121 feet of high-quality, hydrocarbon-bearing sandstone reservoir and represents the tenth discovery on the Block. The well is located approximately 17 miles south of the Turbot-1 well. In February 2019, the operator announced the eleventh and twelfth discoveries on the Stabroek Block at the Tilapia-1 and Haimara-1 wells. The Tilapia-1 well encountered approximately 305 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir, and is located approximately three miles west of the Longtail-1 well. The Haimara-1 well encountered approximately 207 feet of high-quality, gas condensate-bearing sandstone reservoir, and is located approximately 19 miles east of the Pluma-1 well. • At Block 42 (Hess - 33%), offshore Suriname, the operator, Kosmos Energy Ltd., completed drilling operations on the Pontoenoe-1 exploration well. Commercial quantities of hydrocarbons were not discovered and well results will be integrated into the ongoing evaluation for future exploration on the block. Total well costs charged to exploration expenses were $33 million. • In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia (Hess - 50%), the operator, BP Canada, completed drilling of the Aspy exploration well, which did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Total well costs charged to exploration expenses were $120 million. The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2018: • In December 2018, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with HIP to sell HIP our water handling business for $225 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The parties expect to execute definitive agreements and close the transaction in the first quarter of 2019, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals. 24 Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures In 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,939 million (2017: $945 million; 2016: $795 million). At December 31, 2018, consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $2,694 million (2017: $4,847 million), consolidated debt was $6,672 million (2017: $6,977 million), and our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio was 38.0% (2017: 36.1%). Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures United States Bakken $ 967 $ 624 $ 429 Other Onshore 43 30 46 Total Onshore 1,010 654 475 Offshore 368 702 735 Total United States 1,378 1,356 1,210 South America 423 242 144 Europe 8 142 65 Asia and other 260 307 452 E&P - Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 2,069 $ 2,047 $ 1,871 Exploration expenses charged to income included in E&P capital and exploratory expenditures above were: 2018 2017 2016 United States $ 106 $ 90 $ 93 International 54 105 140 Total Exploration Expenses Charged to Income included above $ 160 $ 195 $ 233 2018 2017 2016 Midstream Capital Expenditures Midstream - Capital Expenditures (a) $ 271 $ 121 $ 283 (a) Excludes equity investments of $67 million in 2018.

In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: The following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 35. 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods, After Income Taxes: Exploration and Production $ (86 ) $ (2,609 ) $ (3,699 ) Midstream — (34 ) (21 ) Corporate, Interest and Other (20 ) (30 ) (923 ) Total $ (106 ) $ (2,673 ) $ (4,643 ) The following table reconciles reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation and adjusted net income (loss): 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation $ (282 ) $ (4,074 ) $ (6,132 ) Less: Total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods (106 ) (2,673 ) (4,643 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ (176 ) $ (1,401 ) $ (1,489 ) Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation presented in this report is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income (loss). 26 The following table presents the pre-tax amount of items affecting comparability of income (expense) by financial statement line item in the Statement of Consolidated Income on page 48. The items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 35.

In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for NGLs increased in 2018 by 19% and worldwide natural gas prices increased in 2018 by 24%, compared to the prior year. In total, higher realized selling prices improved 2018 financial results by approximately $700 million after income taxes, compared with 2017. Our average selling prices were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Including Hedging) United States Onshore $ 56.90 $ 46.04 $ 36.92 Offshore 62.02 47.34 37.47 Total United States 58.69 46.50 37.13 Europe 70.08 55.03 43.33 Africa 69.64 53.17 41.88 Asia 70.42 56.99 42.98 Worldwide 60.77 49.23 39.20 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Excluding Hedging) United States Onshore $ 60.64 $ 46.76 $ 36.92 Offshore 65.73 48.15 37.47 Total United States 62.41 47.25 37.13 Europe 70.08 55.14 43.33 Africa 69.64 53.25 41.88 Asia 70.42 56.99 42.98 Worldwide 63.80 49.75 39.20 Natural Gas Liquids - Per Barrel United States Onshore $ 21.29 $ 17.67 $ 9.18 Offshore 25.58 21.34 13.96 Total United States 21.81 18.10 9.71 Europe — 29.04 19.48 Worldwide 21.81 18.35 9.95 Natural Gas - Per Mcf United States Onshore $ 2.29 $ 1.96 $ 1.48 Offshore 2.68 2.22 1.99 Total United States 2.43 2.03 1.61 Europe 3.61 4.42 3.97 Asia and other 5.07 4.27 5.31 Worldwide 4.18 3.37 3.37 (a) Selling prices in the United States are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in Marketing expenses. Excluding these fees Worldwide selling prices for 2018 would be $63.77 per barrel for crude oil (including hedging), $66.80 per barrel for crude oil (excluding hedging), $22.00 per barrel for NGLs and $4.25 per mcf for natural gas. Net realized losses from crude oil hedging contracts reduced Sales and other operating revenues by $183 million ($183 million after income taxes) in 2018, and $59 million ($59 million after income taxes) in 2017. There were no crude oil hedge contracts in 2016. We have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a WTI monthly floor price of $60 per barrel on 95,000 bopd for $116 million, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis during 2019. 28 Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Crude Oil - Barrels United States Bakken 76 67 68 Other Onshore 1 6 9 Total Onshore 77 73 77 Offshore 41 39 45 Total United States 118 112 122 Europe 6 28 33 Africa 18 35 34 Asia 4 2 2 Worldwide 146 177 191 Natural Gas Liquids - Barrels United States Bakken 29 28 27 Other Onshore 5 8 11 Total Onshore 34 36 38 Offshore 5 5 5 Total United States 39 41 43 Europe — 1 1 Worldwide 39 42 44 Natural Gas - Mcf United States Bakken 70 62 61 Other Onshore 44 92 133 Total Onshore 114 154 194 Offshore 67 57 64 Total United States 181 211 258 Europe 8 33 43 Asia and other 364 276 222 Worldwide 553 520 523 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 277 306 322 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production 67 % 72 % 73 % In 2019, we expect net production, excluding Libya, to average between 270,000 boepd and 280,000 boepd, compared to full year pro forma 2018 net production, excluding Libya and assets sold, of 248,000 boepd. Production variances related to 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows: United States: Bakken net production was higher in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to increased drilling activity and improved well performance in the current year. The year-on-year decline in U.S. other onshore production in 2018 and 2017 reflects the sale of our interests in the Utica shale play in August 2018 and the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. Total U.S. offshore oil production was higher in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the Stampede and Penn State Fields, partially offset by the impact of downtime from a planned well workover at the Tubular Bells Field, the shutdown at the third-party operated Enchilada platform, and natural field decline. Total offshore production was lower in 2017, compared to 2016, due to shut-in production from the fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform and natural field decline, partially offset by higher production from the Tubular Bells Field. Production from Utica averaged 9,000 boepd for calendar year 2018 (2017: 19,000 boepd; 2016: 29,000 boepd). Production from the Permian averaged net 4,000 boepd for calendar year 2017 (2016: 7,000 boepd). Europe: Total net production was lower in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the sale of our interests in Norway in December 2017. Crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to natural field decline. Production in Norway averaged 24,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 28,000 boepd). 29 Africa: Crude oil production was lower in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily reflecting the sale of Equatorial Guinea in November 2017, partially offset by higher production in Libya. Crude oil production in 2017 was comparable to 2016, as lower volumes from Equatorial Guinea were offset by higher production in Libya. Production in Equatorial Guinea averaged 25,000 boepd in 2017 (2016: 33,000 boepd). Production in Libya was 20,000 boepd in 2018 (2017: 10,000 boepd; 2016: 1,000 boepd). Asia: Natural gas production was higher in 2018, compared to 2017, and in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to first production at the North Malay Basin full-field development in July 2017. Sales Volumes: The impact of lower sales volumes, primarily due to asset sales, decreased after-tax results by approximately $150 million in 2018, compared to 2017. Worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, excluding sales volumes of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas purchased from third-parties, were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Crude oil - barrels 52,742 63,367 72,462 Natural gas liquids - barrels 14,019 15,152 16,055 Natural gas - mcf 202,041 190,089 191,482 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 100,435 110,201 120,431 Crude oil - barrels per day 144 173 198 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day 39 42 44 Natural gas - mcf per day 553 520 523 Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day 275 302 329 Marketing, including purchased oil and gas: Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGLs and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third-parties, primarily in the U.S., and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. marketing activities. The increases in 2018, compared to 2017, and in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily reflect the impact of higher benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes. Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses, decreased by $221 million in 2018, compared to the prior year (2017: $404 million decrease versus 2016). The decrease in 2018, compared to 2017, is primarily due to asset sales and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher production taxes in the Bakken. The decrease in 2017, compared to 2016, is due to lower workover expenses, lease operating and employee costs, partially offset by higher production taxes in the Bakken. Operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the Gulf of Mexico. Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense in 2018 increased, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher throughput volumes and water disposal activity in 2018, partially offset by lower costs from our former business in the Permian. Tariffs expense in 2017 increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher shortfall fees in 2017. For 2019, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $750 million to $775 million. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) costs decreased by $988 million in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the sale of assets which had higher DD&A rates than the portfolio average, a lower DD&A rate at the Bakken due to year-end 2017 proved reserve additions, and the impact of prior year asset impairments. DD&A costs decreased by $377 million in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower production and an improved portfolio average DD&A rate due to the production mix. Unit costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: Actual Forecast range (a) 2018 2017 2016 2019 Cash operating costs (b) $ 12.66 $ 14.27 $ 15.56 $13.00 — $14.00 DD&A (c) 17.14 24.53 26.40 18.00 — 19.00 Total Production Unit Costs $ 29.80 $ 38.80 $ 41.96 $31.00 — $33.00 (a) Forecast information excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings. (b) Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings and Libya, cash operating costs per boe for 2018 were $13.32 (2017: $14.56; 2016: $15.45). (c) Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings and Libya, DD&A per boe for 2018 were $18.29 (2017: $25.29; 2016: $26.48). 30 Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Exploratory dry hole costs (a) $ 165 $ 268 $ 1,064 Exploration lease and other impairment 37 44 145 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead 160 195 233 $ 362 $ 507 $ 1,442 (a) In 2018, we recorded dry hole costs associated with the Aspy well, offshore Nova Scotia, Canada, the Pontoenoe-1 well, offshore Suriname, and the Sorubim-1 well on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In 2017, we recorded dry hole costs associated with our former interests in Ghana. In 2016, we recorded dry hole costs associated with our former interests in Australia and three exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration expenses were lower in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to lower dry hole expense and lower geologic and seismic costs. Exploration expenses were lower in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower dry hole expense, leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses. See items affecting comparability of earnings between periods described below. For 2019, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million. Income Taxes: The E&P income tax provision was an expense of $391 million in 2018 (2017: $1,842 million benefit; 2016: $1,587 million expense). Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the E&P income tax provision was an expense of $391 million in 2018 (2017: $95 million expense; 2016: $948 million benefit). The provision in 2018 compared to 2017, and 2017 compared to 2016, reflects higher production from Libya and lower deferred tax benefits on losses. Commencing in 2017, we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia and Guyana, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. See E&P items affecting comparability of earnings below and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Income Taxes beginning on page 39. Actual and forecast effective tax rates are as follows: Actual Forecast range 2018 % 2017 % 2016 % 2019 % Effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (88 ) 34 (47 ) N/A Adjusted effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (a) 60 7 42 0 to (4) (a) Excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Gains (losses) on asset sales, net $ 24 $ (41 ) $ 27 $ 24 $ (57 ) $ 17 Exit costs and other (110 ) — (26 ) (110 ) — (17 ) Impairment — (4,203 ) — — (2,250 ) — Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses — (280 ) (1,021 ) — (280 ) (745 ) Noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars — (22 ) — — (22 ) — Income tax adjustments — — — — — (2,869 ) Offshore rig cost — — (105 ) — — (66 ) Inventory write-off — — (39 ) — — (19 ) $ (86 ) $ (4,546 ) $ (1,164 ) $ (86 ) $ (2,609 ) $ (3,699 ) 31 The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income are as follows: Before Income Taxes 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Sales and other operating revenues $ — $ (22 ) $ — Gains (losses) on asset sales, net 24 (41 ) 27 Operating costs and expenses (19 ) — (162 ) Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment (3 ) (280 ) (1,029 ) General and administrative expenses (72 ) — — Depreciation, depletion and amortization (16 ) — — Impairment — (4,203 ) — $ (86 ) $ (4,546 ) $ (1,164 ) 2018: • Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($14 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio and a pre-tax gain of $10 million ($10 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in Ghana. • Exit costs and other: We incurred noncash pre-tax charges of $73 million ($73 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax severance charge of $37 million ($37 million after income taxes), related to a cost reduction program undertaken to reflect the reduced scale of our business following significant asset sales in 2017. 2017: • Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $486 million ($486 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our assets in Equatorial Guinea, and a pre-tax gain of $330 million ($314 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin. We also incurred a pre-tax loss of $857 million ($857 million after income taxes) on the sale of our interests in Norway. The loss included the recognition of $900 million in earnings for cumulative translation adjustments previously reflected within accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 3, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Impairment: We recorded a noncash impairment charge related to our interests in Norway totaling $2,503 million pre-tax ($550 million after income taxes) in the third quarter prior to the sale of our interests in the fourth quarter. In addition, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the Stampede Field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the Tubular Bells Field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily because of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The Stampede Field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the Pony discovery prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. See Note 13, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $280 million ($280 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of our interest at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license, offshore Ghana (Hess 50% license interest) as a result of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2017 to not develop the previously discovered fields. These costs were incurred in periods prior to 2017. • Noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) related to certain crude oil collars not designated as cash flow hedges. The de-designation was a result of production downtime caused by a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter. 2016: • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $938 million ($693 million after income taxes) to write-off all previously capitalized wells and other project related costs for our Equus natural gas project, offshore the North West Shelf of Australia, following the decision to defer further development of the project. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $83 million ($52 million after income taxes) to write-off the previously capitalized Sicily-1 exploration well based on our decision not to pursue the project. These costs were incurred in periods prior to 2016. 32 • Gains on asset sale, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $27 million ($17 million after income taxes) related to the sale of undeveloped onshore acreage in the U.S. • Income taxes: We recorded a non-cash charge of $2,920 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. This deferred tax charge had no impact on the Corporation’s cash flows or its underlying tax positions. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $51 million related to the resolution of certain international tax matters. • Offshore rig cost: We recognized a pre-tax charge of $105 million ($66 million after income taxes) related to an offshore drilling rig. • Inventory write-off: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $39 million ($19 million after income taxes) to write off surplus materials and supplies inventory. • Exit costs and other: We recorded exit and other costs of $26 million ($17 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance as part of a cost reduction program. Midstream Following is a summarized statement of income for our Midstream operations, which include results for a gas plant and associated CO2 assets in the Permian Basin (through August 2017) and water handling services in North Dakota that are wholly-owned by Hess: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues $ 713 $ 617 $ 569 Losses on asset sales, net — (51 ) — Other, net 6 — — Total revenues and non-operating income 719 566 569 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses 193 195 218 General and administrative expenses 14 16 20 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 127 123 121 Impairment — — 67 Interest expense 60 26 19 Total costs and expenses 394 360 445 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes 325 206 124 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (a) 38 31 26 Net income (loss) 287 175 98 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (b) 167 133 56 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ 120 $ 42 $ 42 (a) The provision for income taxes in the Midstream segment in 2018 and 2017 is presented before consolidating its operations with other U.S. activities of the Company and prior to evaluating realizability of net U.S. deferred taxes. An offsetting impact is presented in the E&P segment. (b) The partnership is not subject to tax and, therefore, the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income is a pre-tax amount. Sales and other operating revenues in 2018 increased, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher throughput volumes and water disposal activity in 2018, partially offset by prior year activity associated with our former Permian assets that were sold in August 2017. Sales and other operating revenues in 2017 increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher shortfall fees earned, and higher tariff rates and throughput volumes, partially offset by lower rail export revenue associated with third-party rail charges and the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. Operating costs and expenses in 2018 reflect increased activity related to produced water disposal services and lower costs from our former Permian assets versus the prior year. Operating costs and expenses were lower in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower third-party rail charges and the sale of our Permian assets in August 2017. DD&A expenses were higher in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to pipeline assets that were brought into service in the current year. The increase in interest expense in 2018, compared to 2017, and 2017, compared to 2016, reflects higher borrowings by Hess Infrastructure Partners LP. For 2019, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. 33 Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: We recognized a pre-tax loss of $57 million ($34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) in 2017 related to the sale of our Midstream assets in the Permian Basin. Midstream results in 2016 included a pre-tax charge of $67 million ($21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) to impair older specification rail cars. Corporate, Interest and Other The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 97 $ 160 $ 131 Interest expense 359 385 380 Less: Capitalized interest (20 ) (86 ) (61 ) Interest expense, net 339 299 319 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes 436 459 450 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (3 ) (26 ) (163 ) Net Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes 433 433 287 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after income taxes 20 30 923 Total Corporate, Interest and Other Expenses After Income Taxes $ 453 $ 463 $ 1,210 Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were lower in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to lower employee related costs, non-service pension costs and legal fees. Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher legal costs, increased pension settlement charges in 2017, and the recognition of a nonrecurring gain of $8 million in 2016. In 2019, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Interest expense was lower in 2018, compared to 2017, due to lower average borrowings. Capitalized interest was lower in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the Stampede Field commencing production in January 2018. Interest expense was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to slightly higher average borrowings. Capitalized interest expense was higher in 2017, compared to 2016, due to increased activity at the Hess operated Stampede development project and sanction of the Liza Field Phase 1 development project during 2017. In 2019 after-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $315 million to $325 million. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the benefit for income taxes is lower in 2018 and 2017, compared to 2016, due to us generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in the U.S. while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. This accounting treatment commenced on December 31, 2016. See items affecting comparability of earnings below and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Income Taxes beginning on page 39. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: 2018: • Loss on debt extinguishment: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $53 million ($53 million after income taxes) related to the premium paid for debt repurchases. See Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $58 million ($58 million after income taxes) resulting from the settlement of legal claims related to former downstream interests. • Income tax: We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax benefit of $91 million to offset the recognition of a noncash income tax expense recorded in other comprehensive income resulting primarily from changes in fair value of our 2019 crude oil hedging program, as required under accounting standards. 2017: • Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($30 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space, of which $11 million is included in General and administrative expenses and $19 million is included in Depreciation, depletion and amortization in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 34 2016: • Income tax: We recorded a non-cash charge of $829 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, as required under application of the accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. This deferred tax charge had no impact on the Corporation’s cash flows or its underlying tax positions. • Loss on debt extinguishment: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $148 million ($92 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase and redemption of notes to complete a debt refinancing. • Exit costs and other: We recorded exit and other costs of $3 million ($2 million after income taxes), which primarily relates to employee severance. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2018 2017 (In millions, except ratio) Cash and cash equivalents (a) $ 2,694 $ 4,847 Current maturities of long-term debt 67 580 Total debt (b) 6,672 6,977 Total equity 10,888 12,354 Debt to capitalization ratio (c) 38.0 % 36.1 % (a) Includes $109 million of cash attributable to our Midstream Segment, at December 31, 2018 (2017: $356 million). (b) Includes $981 million of debt outstanding from HIP at December 31, 2018 (2017: $980 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. (c) Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,939 $ 945 $ 795 Investing activities (1,566 ) 1,358 (2,090 ) Financing activities (2,526 ) (188 ) 1,311 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (2,153 ) $ 2,115 $ 16 Operating Activities: In 2018, net cash provided by operating activities increased, compared to 2017, primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower production volumes largely due to asset sales. In 2017, operating cash flows increased, compared to 2016, primarily due to higher benchmark crude oil prices and lower operating costs, partially offset by lower production volumes. Changes in working capital in 2018 reduced cash by $186 million (2017: $780 million reduction; 2016: $47 million reduction), primarily from premiums on crude oil hedge contracts and abandonment expenditures. Changes in working capital in 2017 included increased accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices, abandonment expenditures, premiums on crude oil hedge contracts, pension contributions, contract termination payments for an offshore drilling rig, and crude oil delivered as line fill. Investing Activities: Total addition to property, plant and equipment were $2,097 million in 2018 (2017: $1,937 million; 2016: $2,251 million). The increase in Additions to property, plant and equipment in 2018, compared to 2017, is primarily related to increased expenditures in the Bakken, offshore Guyana, offshore Canada and in our Midstream segment, primarily offset by the impact of prior year asset sales and reduced development expenditure in both the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia. In 2017, Additions to property, plant and equipment were lower, compared to 2016, primarily due to lower development expenditures at North Malay Basin, partially offset by increased investments in Bakken and Guyana in 2017. In 2018, Midstream equity investments in its 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources were $67 million. Proceeds from the sale of assets of $607 million in 2018 (2017: $3,296 million; 2016: $140 million) include the divestiture of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio, and our share of proceeds from the sale and lease-back transaction of the North Malay Basin floating storage and offloading vessel. Financing Activities: Repayments of debt were $633 million in 2018 (2017: $459 million; 2016: $1,455 million) while borrowings of debt with maturities in excess of 90 days were $800 million in 2017 and $1,496 million in 2016. We settled common stock purchases in the amount of $1,365 million in 2018 (2017: $110 million). Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $345 million in 2018 (2017: $363 million; 2016: $350 million). In 2017, Hess Midstream Partners LP received 35 proceeds of $365.5 million from the issuance of common units in an initial public offering, of which $350 million was distributed equally to Hess Corporation and GIP. Net outflows to noncontrolling interests were $211 million in 2018 (2017: $243 million net outflow; 2016: $23 million net outflow). In 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for total net proceeds of $1.64 billion. Future Capital Requirements and Resources At December 31, 2018, Hess Corporation, had $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $7.0 billion. The Corporation has no significant near-term debt maturities. We have purchased crude oil put options for calendar year 2019 that establish a WTI monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 95,000 bopd. Net production in 2019 is forecast to be in the range of 270,000 boepd to 280,000 boepd, excluding Libya, and we expect our 2019 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.9 billion. Based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2019, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2018, will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends through the end of 2019. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2018: Letters of Expiration Credit Total Available Date Capacity Borrowings Issued Used Capacity (In millions) Hess Corporation Revolving credit facility - Hess Corporation (a) January 2021 $ 4,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,000 Committed lines Various (b) 445 — 29 29 416 Uncommitted lines Various (b) 255 — 255 255 — Total - Hess Corporation $ 4,700 $ — $ 284 $ 284 $ 4,416 Midstream Revolving credit facility - HIP (c) November 2022 $ 600 $ — $ — $ — $ 600 Revolving credit facility - Hess Midstream Partners LP (d) March 2021 300 — — — 300 Total - Midstream $ 900 $ — $ — $ — $ 900 (a) In January 2020, the capacity reduces to $3.7 billion. (b) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates throughout 2019. (c) This credit facility may only be utilized by HIP and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. (d) This credit facility may only be utilized by Hess Midstream Partners LP and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. The Corporation’s $4.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility expires in January 2021, with commitments of $3.7 billion available for the final year. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered. The facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 60% of the Corporation’s total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2018, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant. We had $284 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2018 (2017: $246 million), which primarily relate to our international operations. See also Note 21, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. At December 31, 2018, HIP has $800 million of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing November 2022, consisting of a $600 million 5-year revolving credit facility and a drawn $200 million 5-year Term Loan A facility. The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on HIP’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). If HIP obtains an investment grade credit rating, as defined in the amended credit agreement, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time 36 to time. The credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as EBITDA to cash interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The amended credit agreement includes a secured leverage ratio test not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for so long as the facilities remain secured. HIP is in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2018. Outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. At December 31, 2018, HIP’s revolving credit facility was undrawn and borrowings under the Term Loan A facility amounted to $197.5 million, excluding deferred issuance costs. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of HIP’s and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ directly owned assets, including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries, subject to customary exclusions. Hess Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership”) has a $300 million 4-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility that became available for utilization at completion of its initial public offering in April 2017. The credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund operating activities and capital expenditures of the Partnership and expires March 2021. Borrowings on the credit facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.275%. The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the Partnership’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to EBITDA. If the Partnership obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The Partnership is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement, including financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The credit facility is secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all directly owned assets of the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including equity interests in subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exclusions. Outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. At December 31, 2018, this facility was undrawn. Credit Ratings Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt have assigned an investment grade rating. At December 31, 2018, we have investment grade credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings (BBB-). Moody’s Investors Service has rated our debt at Ba1. The consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements, which are not material. At December 31, 2018, HIP’s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service, and BB by Fitch Ratings. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2018: Payments Due by Period 2020 and 2022 and Total 2019 2021 2023 Thereafter (In millions) Total Debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 6,672 $ 67 $ 66 $ 192 $ 6,347 Operating Leases (b) (c) 902 355 221 128 198 Purchase Obligations: Capital expenditures (c) 1,069 443 551 75 — Operating expenses (c) 433 219 99 61 54 Transportation and related contracts (c) 1,050 212 401 336 101 Asset retirement obligations 857 116 75 36 630 Other liabilities 518 121 93 84 220 (a) We anticipate cash payments for interest of $401 million for 2019, $775 million for 2020-2021, $752 million for 2022-2023, and $3,912 million thereafter for a total of $5,840 million. These interest payments reflect our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018. (b) On January 1, 2019, we will adopt ASC 842, Leases, which will result in operating lease commitments greater than one year being reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 1, Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. (c) Comprises obligations where we, as operator, have contracted directly with suppliers. Capital expenditures represent amounts that we were contractually committed at December 31, 2018, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2019. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, support vessels, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. 37 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2018, we had $284 million in letters of credit. See also Note 19, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations We conduct E&P activities outside the U.S., principally in the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand and Malaysia, Denmark, Libya, Guyana, Suriname, and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, currency risk, corruption, and acts of terrorism. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E&P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year. Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2019 are at levels below that used in determining 2018 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2019 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2019 above those used in determining 2018 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2019, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2019 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2019 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018 would result in an approximate $200 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2019 based on projected production volumes. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 82 through 92 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves. 38 Midstream Joint Venture: We consolidate the activities of our 50/50 joint venture HIP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered HIP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between HIP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of HIP. Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. Our impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. While crude oil prices in 2018 were higher than the last few years, we could experience an asset impairment in the future if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We conduct the goodwill test at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from several factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. At December 31, 2018, our Midstream operating segment had goodwill of $360 million that resulted from an allocation from our E&P segment upon the formation of the Midstream segment in 2015. Our E&P segment has no goodwill at December 31, 2018. To determine whether an indicator of impairment exists, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over fair value, limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Fair value for the Midstream operating segment is based on a market approach, whereby the market capitalization of Hess Midstream Partners, LP’s (the Partnership), which represents an approximate 20% economic interest in the operating companies that comprise the Midstream segment, is adjusted to an amount equal to a 100% economic interest in the operating companies based on the Partnership’s stock price at the time of the impairment test. Other adjustments made to compute fair value include estimating the fair value of other minor Midstream assets not owned by the Partnership and long-term debt held directly by HIP. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. 39 The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year. Due to a sustained low commodity price environment, we remained in a three-year cumulative consolidated loss position at December 31, 2018. A three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia, and Guyana, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. At December 31, 2018, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $4,877 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth. Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E&P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations. Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. The most significant assumptions relate to: Discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations: The discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. At December 31, 2018, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately $100 million and forecasted 2019 annual benefit expense by approximately $5 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligation would decrease the funded status of our pension plans, but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolio. Expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets: The expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. At December 31, 2018, a 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2019 annual benefit expense by approximately $5 million. Other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality level. 40 Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value assigned for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Environment, Health and Safety Our long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. We are committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions mandates and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore E&P facilities, sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2018, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $15 million in 2018 (2017: $15 million; 2016: $10 million). The amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 41 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options in our risk management activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them: • Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third-parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound, which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of British Pound at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. • Exchange Traded Contracts: We may use exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and have the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. Financial Risk Management Activities At December 31, 2018, outstanding total debt, excluding capital leases, was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments with a carrying value of $6,403 million and a fair value of $6,225 million. A 15% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $480 million or $550 million, respectively. Any changes in interest rates do not impact cash outflows associated with fixed rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity. At December 31, 2018, we have outstanding WTI crude oil put contracts for calendar year 2019 with a WTI monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 95,000 bopd. At December 31, 2018, an assumed 10% increase in the forward WTI crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our crude oil put contracts would reduce the fair value of these derivatives instruments by approximately $120 million, while an assumed 10% decrease in the same WTI crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $140 million. We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of $16 million at December 31, 2018 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of less than $5 million at December 31, 2018.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chief Executive Officer February 21, 2019 44 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York February 21, 2019 45 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “Hess”, “the Corporation”, “Registrant”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the consolidated business operations of Hess Corporation and its affiliates. Nature of Business: Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, Suriname, Canada and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we have participated in twelve significant discoveries and sanctioned in 2017 the first phase of development of the block. Our Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGLs; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGLs; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess Corporation and entities in which we own more than a 50% voting interest. We also consolidate Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), a variable interest entity, based on our conclusion that we have the power through our 50% ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. Our undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas E&P ventures are proportionately consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned and where we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method. In 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method. Accordingly, the required disclosures under ASC 606 were provided only for the current period. The adoption of this standard did not affect the timing of revenue recognition for our uncompleted contracts at January 1, 2018, and as a result, no cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings was recognized. Accounts receivables from contracts with customers is presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the prior year balance recast to conform to the current period presentation. In addition, as the adoption of ASC 606 did not affect previous conclusions regarding our involvement as a principal versus agent in contracts with customers, there were no changes in presentation to the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU contains a provision that prohibits the capitalization of the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost when constructing or producing an asset. This provision was applied prospectively effective January 1, 2018. The ASU contains another provision requiring that non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost be presented separately from the service cost component in the Statement of Consolidated Income. We elected the practical expedient allowing the use of amounts previously disclosed in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements as the basis for the required retrospective application of this provision, as capitalization of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost was not material. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the retrospective application resulted in the reclassification of net expense totaling $14 million and $5 million, respectively to Other, net from Operating costs and expenses and General and administrative expenses in our Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the existing hedge accounting guidance. The adoption of this ASU resulted in an increase to Retained earnings and a decrease in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $1 million in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in order to remove the cumulative effect of hedging ineffectiveness previously recognized in earnings for contracts designated as hedging instruments that were outstanding at January 1, 2018. In 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU allows the reclassification of stranded income tax effects within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained earnings that resulted from the enactment of U.S. Federal income tax reform, commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”). Specifically, this ASU provides entities the option to reclassify the stranded income tax effects resulting from the reduction to the corporate income tax rate from the Act upon adoption of this ASU, instead of upon liquidation of the individual items (or of the underlying portfolio of items). This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. We elected to adopt this ASU effective October 1, 2018. The adoption resulted in an increase to Retained earnings and a decrease to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $100 million in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU requires the total change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash be reflected 52 on the statement of cash flows. A reconciliation to the balance sheet is also required when cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are not separately presented on the balance sheet or are presented in more than one financial statement line item on the balance sheet. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. In 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance addresses eight specific classification issues for which current guidance is either unclear or is non-specific. The requirement that fees paid to third-parties and premiums incurred relating to the repayment of debt be classified as financing cash outflows is among the classification issues addressed by this ASU. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. In 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU modifies the concept of goodwill impairment from a condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to a condition that exists when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Thus, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted. We elected to adopt this ASU effective October 1, 2018, and the adoption had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates and Assumptions: In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in our Statement of Consolidated Income. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves, asset and other valuations, depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes. Revenue Recognition: See Note 2, Revenue. Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: We record depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production facilities and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. Capitalized Interest: Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets. Impairment of Long‑lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a projected amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally 53 differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows reported in Supplementary Oil and Gas Data, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. To determine whether an indicator of impairment exists, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over fair value, limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2018, goodwill of $360 million relates to the Midstream operating segment. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily comprises cash on hand and on deposit, as well as highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired. Inventories: Unsold crude oil and NGLs are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined based on the average cost of production. Materials and supplies are valued at cost. Obsolete or surplus materials identified during periodic reviews are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year. We assign cumulative historical losses significant weight in the evaluation of realizability relative to more subjective evidence such as forecasts of future income. In addition, we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We are no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to the book in excess of tax basis in the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Because of U.S. tax reform we expect that the future reversal of such temporary differences will occur free of material taxation. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. We account for the U.S. tax effect of global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries in the period that such income is earned. We utilize the aggregate approach for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or the seabed at certain E&P locations. We initially recognize a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred, and capitalize the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long‑lived assets. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Fair value is determined by applying a credit adjusted risk-free rate to the undiscounted expected future abandonment expenditures, which represent Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy defined under Fair Value Measurements below. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Retirement Plans: We recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. We recognize the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the remaining average expected life if a plan’s participants are predominantly inactive. Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments for financial risk management activities. In these activities, we may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. 54 All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by GAAP. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying nonmonetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long‑lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value assigned for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve, but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Netting of Financial Instruments: We generally enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate legal and counterparty credit risk. Master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty, commonly known as the “safe harbor” provisions. If a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterparty’s bankruptcy, these rights are generally enforceable with respect to “safe harbor” transactions. If these arrangements provide the right of offset and our intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination, our policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis. In the normal course of business, we rely on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses providing for adequate credit assurance as well as close‑out netting, including two‑party netting and single counterparty multilateral netting. As applied to us, “two‑party netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single Hess entity, and “single counterparty multilateral netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple Hess entities. We are reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Share-based Compensation: We account for share-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting. The fair value of all share‑based compensation is recognized over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting, net of actual forfeitures. We estimate fair value at the date of grant using a Black‑Scholes 55 valuation model for employee stock options and a Monte Carlo simulation model for performance share units. Fair value of restricted stock is based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. Foreign Currency Translation: The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in which business is conducted) for our foreign operations. Adjustments resulting from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. For our former operations in Norway that did not use the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency, adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in a separate component of equity titled Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) prior to the disposition. See Note 3, Dispositions. Maintenance and Repairs: Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capital improvements are recorded as additions in Property, plant and equipment. Environmental Expenditures: We accrue and expense the undiscounted environmental costs necessary to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year‑end 2018, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million. Environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment are capitalized. New Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, as a new ASC Topic, ASC 842. The new standard supersedes ASC 840 and will require the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases with lease terms greater than one year, including leases currently treated as operating leases under ASC 840. ASC 842 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019. We have elected to adopt ASC 842 using the modified retrospective method which allows application of the new standard prospectively from the date of adoption with a cumulative effect adjustment, if any, recorded to Retained Earnings at the date of adoption. Accordingly, comparative financial statements for periods prior to the adoption date of ASC 842 will not be affected. In addition, we have elected to apply a number of practical expedients permitted by the ASU, including not needing to reassess: (i) whether existing contracts are (or contain) leases, (ii) whether the lease classification for existing leases would differ under ASC 842, (iii) whether initial direct costs incurred for existing leases are capitalizable under ASC 842, and (iv) land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under ASC 840. We have completed our implementation plan to adopt ASU 842, but we continue to monitor standard setting activity and our internal controls to comply with the accounting and disclosure requirements. Upon adoption on January 1, 2019, we expect to recognize operating and finance lease obligations totaling approximately $1.2 billion, of which approximately $390 million of liabilities at December 31, 2018, are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We enter into various leases in the normal course of business primarily for drilling rigs, a floating storage and offloading vessel, support vessels, and office space. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. This ASU makes changes to the impairment model for trade receivables, net investments in leases, debt securities, loans and certain other instruments. The standard requires the use of a forward-looking ""expected loss"" model compared to the current ""incurred loss"" model. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019. We are currently assessing the impact of the ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 56 2. Revenue Revenue from contracts with customers on a disaggregated basis in 2018 was as follows (in millions): Exploration and Production Midstream Eliminations Total United States Europe Africa Asia E&P Total Sales of our net production volumes: Crude oil revenue $ 2,832 $ 153 $ 434 $ 104 $ 3,523 $ — $ — $ 3,523 Natural gas liquids revenue 308 — — — 308 — — 308 Natural gas revenue 176 11 21 651 859 — — 859 Sales of purchased oil and gas 1,661 — 93 14 1,768 — — 1,768 Intercompany revenue — — — — — 713 (713 ) — Total revenues from contracts with customers 4,977 164 548 769 6,458 713 (713 ) 6,458 Other operating revenues (a) (135 ) — — — (135 ) — — (135 ) Total sales and other operating revenues $ 4,842 $ 164 $ 548 $ 769 $ 6,323 $ 713 $ (713 ) $ 6,323 (a) Includes gains (losses) on commodity derivatives. Exploration and Production The E&P segment recognizes revenue from the sale of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas as performance obligations under contracts with customers are satisfied. Our responsibilities to deliver each unit of quantity of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas under these contracts represent separate, distinct performance obligations. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer. Generally, the control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer upon the transfer of legal title at the point of physical delivery. Pricing is variable and is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials. For long-term international natural gas contracts with ship-or-pay provisions, our obligation to stand-ready to provide a minimum volume over each commitment period represents separate, distinct performance obligations. Penalties owed against future deliveries of natural gas due to delivery of volumes below minimum delivery commitments are recognized as reductions to revenue in the commitment period when the shortfall occurs. Long-term international natural gas contracts may also contain take-or-pay provisions whereby the customer is required to pay for volumes not taken that are below the minimum volume commitment, but the customer has certain make-up rights to receive shortfall volumes in subsequent periods. Shortfall payments received from customers when volumes purchased are below the minimum volume commitment are deferred upon receipt as a contract liability. Revenue is recognized at the earlier of when we deliver the make-up volumes in subsequent periods or when it becomes remote that the customer will exercise their make-up rights. Certain crude oil, NGL, and natural gas volumes are purchased by Hess from third-parties, including working interest partners and royalty owners in certain Hess-operated properties, before they are sold to customers. Where control over the crude oil, NGLs, or natural gas transfers to Hess before the volumes are transferred to the customer, revenue and the associated cost of purchased volumes are presented on a gross basis in the Statement of Consolidated Income within Sales and other operating revenues and Marketing, including purchased oil and gas, respectively. Where control of crude oil, NGLs, or natural gas is not transferred to Hess, revenue is presented net of the associated cost of purchased volumes within Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Contract types The following is a summary of contract types for our E&P segment: Crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas – United States (U.S.): Contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas primarily include those contracts that involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period, and those contracts that automatically renew on a periodic basis until either party cancels. We have certain long-term contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. natural gas and NGLs that have remaining durations of less than ten years. Contracts may specify a fixed volume for delivery subject to tolerance thresholds or may specify a percentage of production to be delivered from a particular location. Pricing is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials. Crude oil – International: Contracts with customers for the sale of international crude oil involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period. These contracts specify a fixed volume for delivery subject to tolerance thresholds. Pricing is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials, shortly after control of the volumes transfers to the customer. 57 Natural gas – International: Contracts with customers for the sale of natural gas are in the form of natural gas sales agreements with government entities that have durations that are aligned with the durations of production sharing contracts or other contractual arrangements with host governments. Pricing is determined using contractual formulas that are based on the price of alternative fuels as obtained from price indices and other factors. These contracts also specify a minimum volume we are obligated to make available during specified periods within the contract term and may specify minimum volumes the customer is obligated to purchase during specified periods within the contract term. If we do not deliver the volume properly nominated by the customer, the customer is entitled to a price discount on future volumes equivalent to the shortfall delivery. Under certain international natural gas sales agreements, if the customer purchases natural gas volumes below the minimum volume commitment, the customer is required to pay us for the shortfall volumes and may receive make-up volumes in subsequent periods at no additional cost. Revenue from sale of third-party purchased volumes: Crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas are purchased by Hess from third-parties, including working interest partners and royalty owners in certain Hess-operated properties, before they are sold to customers. The types of contracts with customers for the sale of third-party purchased volumes are the same as those described above. Contract Balances Our right to receive or collect payment from the customer is aligned with the timing of revenue recognition except in situations when we receive shortfall payments under contracts with take-or-pay provisions with customer make-up rights or where we recognize a liability for price discounts owed against future deliveries as a result of not shipping minimum volume commitments. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no contract assets or contract liabilities, respectively. Generally, we receive payments from customers on a monthly basis, shortly after the physical delivery of the crude oil, NGLs, or natural gas. In 2018, we did not recognize any impairment losses on receivables arising from contracts with customers. Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations The transaction price allocated to our wholly unsatisfied performance obligations on uncompleted contracts is variable. Further, many of our contracts with customers have durations of less than twelve months. Accordingly, we have elected under the provisions of ASC 606 the exemption from disclosure of revenue recognizable in future periods as these performance obligations are satisfied. Sales-based Taxes We exclude sales-based taxes that are collected from customers from the transaction price in our contracts with customers. Accordingly, revenue from contracts with customers is net of sales-based taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Midstream Our Midstream segment provides gathering, compression, processing, fractionation, storage, terminaling, loading and transportation, and water handling services. The Midstream segment has multiple long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with a marketing subsidiary of Hess, each generally with an initial ten-year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of our Midstream segment. These contracts have minimum volumes the customer is obligated to provide each calendar quarter. The minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation based on nominations covering substantially all of our E&P segment’s production and projected third-party volumes that will be purchased in the Bakken. As the minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation, and as these contracts contain fee inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, substantially all of the transaction price at contract inception is variable. The Midstream segment also provides water handling services to a subsidiary of Hess for an agreed-upon fee per barrel or the reimbursement of third-party fees. The Midstream segment’s responsibilities to provide each of the above services for each year under each of the commercial agreements are considered separate, distinct performance obligations. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation under these commercial agreements over-time as services are rendered using the output method, measured using the amount of volumes serviced during the period. The Midstream segment has elected the practical expedient under the provisions of ASC 606 to recognize revenue in the amount it is entitled to invoice. If the commercial agreements have take-or-pay provisions, the Midstream segment’s responsibility to stand-ready to service a minimum volume over each quarterly commitment period represent separate, distinct performance obligations. Shortfall payments received under take-or-pay provisions are recognized as revenue in the calendar quarter the shortfall occurs as the customer does not have make-up rights beyond the calendar quarter 58 end of the quarterly commitment period. All revenues, receivables, and contract balances arising from the commercial agreements between the Midstream segment and the Hess marketing subsidiary that is the counterparty to the commercial agreements are eliminated upon consolidation. 3. Dispositions 2018: We completed the sale of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio in August for proceeds of $396 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($14 million after income taxes). In addition, we completed the sale of our interests in Ghana for total consideration of $100 million, consisting of a $25 million payment that was received at closing and a further payment of $75 million that is payable to us upon the buyer receiving government approval for a Plan of Development on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block. The receipt of proceeds at closing resulted in a pre-tax gain of $10 million ($10 million after income taxes). 2017: We completed the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin in August for proceeds of $597 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $273 million ($280 million attributable to Hess Corporation after income taxes and noncontrolling interest). This sale transaction included both upstream and midstream assets resulting in an after-tax gain of $314 million allocated to the E&P segment, and an after-tax loss of $34 million allocated to the Midstream segment. In November, we completed the sale of our interests in Equatorial Guinea for proceeds of $449 million, after normal closing adjustments, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $486 million ($486 million after income taxes). In December, we completed the sale of our interests in the Valhall and Hod assets, offshore Norway for proceeds of $2,056 million, after normal closing adjustments, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $857 million ($857 million after income taxes). This loss includes a recognition in earnings of $900 million for cumulative translation adjustments that were previously reflected within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Stockholders’ Equity. We also sold certain U.S. onshore assets for proceeds totaling approximately $194 million and recognized net pre-tax gains totaling $12 million ($12 million after income taxes). Pre-tax income (loss) associated with our interests in Equatorial Guinea and Norway, excluding the financial statement impacts resulting from the asset sales in 2017, were as follows for the three years ended December 31: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Equatorial Guinea (a) $ — $ 69 $ (95 ) Norway (b) — (55 ) (195 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes $ — $ 14 $ (290 ) (a) Pre-tax income for 2017 excludes the gain of $486 million related to sale of our assets in November 2017. (b) Pre-tax loss for 2017 excludes the loss of $857 million related to sale of our assets in December 2017. In addition, the 2017 loss excludes a pre-tax impairment charge of $2,503 million associated with the disposition. 2016: We sold miscellaneous non-core assets during the year for proceeds totaling approximately $100 million and recognized net pre-tax gains totaling $23 million ($14 million after income taxes). The asset sales in 2018 and 2017 high grade our portfolio by divesting of lower return, mature assets to invest in higher return assets, primarily in Guyana and the Bakken, and to fund purchases of common stock and retirement of debt in 2018. 4. Inventories Inventories at December 31 were as follows: 2018 2017 (In millions) Crude oil and natural gas liquids $ 74 $ 59 Materials and supplies 171 173 Total Inventories $ 245 $ 232 59 5. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 were as follows: 2018 2017 (In millions) Exploration and Production Unproved properties $ 394 $ 520 Proved properties 3,124 3,162 Wells, equipment and related facilities 26,173 25,550 29,691 29,232 Midstream 3,492 3,219 Corporate and Other 39 53 Total — at cost 33,222 32,504 Less: Reserves for depreciation, depletion, amortization and lease impairment 17,139 16,312 Property, Plant and Equipment — Net $ 16,083 $ 16,192 Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs: The following table discloses the amount of capitalized exploratory well costs pending determination of proved reserves at December 31, and the changes therein during the respective years: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $ 304 $ 597 $ 1,415 Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves 128 116 79 Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves — (165 ) — Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense (14 ) (268 ) (897 ) Dispositions and other — 24 — Balance at December 31 $ 418 $ 304 $ 597 Number of Wells at December 31 24 12 17 During the three years ended December 31, 2018, additions to capitalized exploratory well costs primarily related to drilling at the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. Other drilling activity included the Bunga prospect in Malaysia during 2018 and in the Gulf of Mexico during 2016. Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves primarily related to the sanction of the first phase of Liza Field development, offshore Guyana in 2017. Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense include the following: 2018: In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia (Hess 50% participating interest), the operator, BP Canada, completed drilling of the Aspy exploration well, which did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. As a result, we expensed well costs totaling $120 million of which $106 million were incurred and expensed in 2018. 2017: In Ghana, at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license (Hess 50% license interest), management determined in the fourth quarter of 2017 that it would not develop the previously discovered fields. As a result, we recorded a charge of $268 million to write-off previously capitalized exploration wells. 2016: At the Hess-operated Equus natural gas project, offshore the North West Shelf of Australia in the fourth quarter of 2016, we terminated a joint front-end engineering study with a third-party natural gas liquefaction joint venture and notified the Australian government of our intent to defer the project. As a result, we expensed all well costs associated with the project, including an exploration well completed in the second quarter of 2016, totaling $830 million. These properties were sold in 2017. In the second quarter of 2016, we expensed costs associated with two exploration wells at the non-operated Sicily project in the Gulf of Mexico where hydrocarbons were encountered but we decided not to pursue the project due to the low commodity price environment and the limited time remaining on the leases. We also expensed the cost of an unsuccessful exploration well at the non-operated Melmar project in the Gulf of Mexico, where noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons were encountered. The preceding table excludes exploratory dry hole costs of $151 million in 2018 (2017: $0 million; 2016: $167 million), which were incurred and subsequently expensed in the same year. In 2018, these costs are associated with the Aspy well, offshore Nova Scotia, Canada, the Pontoenoe-1 well, offshore Suriname, the Sorubim-1 well on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, and the Bunga Teruntum-1 well in North Malay Basin. 60 Exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling were $267 million at December 31, 2018, separated by year of completion as follows (in millions): 2017 $ 97 2016 — 2015 166 2014 — 2013 4 $ 267 Gulf of Mexico: Approximately 45% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the appraisal of the northern portion of the Shenzi Field (Hess 28% participating interest) in the Gulf of Mexico, where hydrocarbons were encountered in the fourth quarter of 2015. Following exploration and appraisal drilling activities completed by the operator in prior years on adjacent blocks to the north of our Shenzi blocks, the operator is planning to acquire 3D seismic in 2019 for use in development planning of the northern portion of the Shenzi Field. Guyana: Approximately 35% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the Liza-4, Payara-1, Payara-2 and Snoek-1 wells on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana (Hess 30%), where hydrocarbons were encountered. The operator plans to integrate the Liza-4 discovery into the second phase of development, which is expected to commence production by mid-2022. The operator plans to integrate the Payara-1 and Payara-2 discoveries into the third phase of development, which is expected to commence production as early as 2023. The Snoek discovery is expected to produce into the Liza Phase 1 FPSO under a subsequent phase of development. JDA: Approximately 15% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess 50%) where hydrocarbons were encountered in three successful exploration wells drilled in the western part of Block A-18. The operator has submitted a development plan concept to the regulator to facilitate commercial negotiations for an extension of the existing gas sales contract to include development of the western part of the Block. Malaysia: Approximately 5% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia (Hess 50%), where hydrocarbons were encountered in one successful exploration well drilled in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2018, we completed four exploration wells and are conducting subsurface evaluations for consideration in future phases of field development. 6. Hess Infrastructure Partners LP On July 1, 2015, we sold a 50% interest in Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP) to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion. HIP and its affiliates primarily comprise our Midstream operating segment. The Midstream operating segment currently generates substantially all of its revenues under long-term, fee-based agreements with our E&P operating segment and intends to pursue additional throughput volumes from third-parties in the Williston Basin area. We operate the Midstream assets and operations, including routine and emergency maintenance and repair services under various operational and administrative services agreements. The tariff agreements between our E&P operating segment and the Midstream entities became effective on January 1, 2014 and are 10-year, fee-based commercial agreements, with HIP having the sole option to renew the agreements for an additional 10-year term. These agreements include minimum volume commitments based on dedicated production, inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms. The Midstream segment has minimal direct commodity price exposure, and the E&P segment retains ownership of the crude oil, natural gas or NGLs processed, terminaled, stored or transported by the Midstream segment. We consolidate the activities of HIP, a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and GIP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. GAAP. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power, through our 50% ownership, to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered HIP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between HIP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of HIP. At December 31, 2018, HIP liabilities totaling $1,105 million (2017: $1,065 million) are on a nonrecourse basis to Hess Corporation, while HIP assets available to settle the obligations of HIP included Cash and cash equivalents totaling $109 million (2017: $356 million) and Property, plant and equipment, net totaling $2,664 million (2017: $2,520 million). 61 7. Hess Midstream Partners LP – Initial Public Offering In April 2017, Hess Midstream Partners LP (the “Partnership”), sold 16,997,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price of $23 per unit in an initial public offering (IPO) for net proceeds of $365.5 million, of which $350 million was distributed equally to Hess Corporation and GIP. The Partnership owns an approximate 20% controlling interest in the operating companies that comprise our midstream joint venture, while HIP, the 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and GIP, owns the remaining 80%. Hess Corporation and GIP each own a direct 33.75% limited partner interest in the Partnership and a 50% indirect ownership interest through HIP in the Partnership’s general partner, which has a 2% economic interest in the Partnership plus incentive distribution rights. The public unit holders own a 30.5% limited partner interest in the Partnership. 8. Debt Total debt at December 31 consisted of the following: 2018 2017 (In millions) Debt - Hess Corporation: Fixed-rate public notes: 8.1% due 2019 $ — $ 349 3.5% due 2024 298 297 4.3% due 2027 992 991 7.9% due 2029 463 500 7.3% due 2031 627 679 7.1% due 2033 537 596 6.0% due 2040 740 740 5.6% due 2041 1,234 1,234 5.8% due 2047 493 493 Total fixed-rate public notes 5,384 5,879 Capital lease obligations 269 — Financing obligations associated with floating production system 40 118 Fair value adjustments - interest rate hedging (2 ) — Total Debt - Hess Corporation $ 5,691 $ 5,997 Debt - Midstream: Fixed-rate notes: 5.6% due 2026 - HIP $ 787 $ 785 Term loan A facility - HIP 194 195 Total Debt - Midstream $ 981 $ 980 Total Debt: Current maturities of long-term debt $ 67 $ 580 Long-term debt 6,605 6,397 Total Debt $ 6,672 $ 6,977 At December 31, 2018, the maturity profile of total debt was as follows: Total Hess Corporation Midstream (In millions) 2019 $ 67 $ 56 $ 11 2020 32 17 15 2021 34 18 16 2022 171 19 152 2023 21 21 — Thereafter 6,347 5,560 787 Total debt (excluding interest) $ 6,672 $ 5,691 $ 981 62 Debt – Hess Corporation: Fixed-rate public notes: At December 31, 2018, Hess Corporation’s fixed-rate public notes had a gross principal amount of $5,438 million (2017: $5,938 million) and a weighted average interest rate of 5.9% (2017: 6.0%). Our long‑term debt agreements, including the revolving credit facility, contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. The most restrictive of these covenants allow us to borrow up to an additional $3,098 million of secured debt at December 31, 2018. Capitalized interest was $20 million in 2018 (2017: $86 million; 2016: $61 million). In 2018, we paid $553 million to redeem $350 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due 2019 and to purchase other notes with a carrying value of $150 million. As a result, we recorded total losses on debt extinguishment of $53 million in 2018 (2017: $0 million; 2016: $148 million). Concurrent with the redemption of the 2019 notes, we terminated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $350 million. Capital lease: In 2018, we entered into a sale and lease-back arrangement for a floating storage and offloading vessel (FSO) to handle produced condensate at North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia (Hess operated – 50%). Pursuant to the sale agreement, we received total proceeds of approximately $260 million, including our partner’s share of the proceeds which is reported in Accounts Payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. No gain or loss was recognized from the sale transaction. The lease agreement is for 16 years with four consecutive twelve-month renewal options that may be exercised at our discretion. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the lease asset is $264 million and the carrying value of the lease obligation is $269 million, which represents 100% of the present value of future minimum lease payments, of which $15 million is included in Current maturities of long-term debt and $254 million is included in Long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As the payments under the lease agreement become due, we will bill our partner their proportionate share for reimbursement pursuant to the terms of our joint operating agreement. Credit facility: Hess Corporation’s $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility expires in January 2021, with commitments of $3.7 billion available for the final year. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered. The facility contains a financial covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 60% of the Corporation’s total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2018, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant. Other outstanding letters of credit at December 31 were as follows: 2018 2017 (In millions) Committed lines (a) $ 29 $ 29 Uncommitted lines (a) 255 217 Total $ 284 $ 246 (a) At December 31, 2018, committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates throughout 2019. Debt - Midstream: Our Midstream segment holds the following non-recourse debt: Hess Infrastructure Partners (HIP): In November 2017, HIP issued $800 million of 5.625% senior notes, due in February 2026 and concurrently amended its senior unsecured credit facilities. HIP used a portion of the proceeds from the note issuance to repay borrowings under HIP’s credit facilities and to fund a distribution to the partners. Under the amended credit facilities, the 5-year Term Loan A facility was reduced to $200 million and the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility increased to $600 million from $400 million previously, with the maturity of both facilities extended to November 2022. The amended facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of HIP’s and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ directly owned assets, including its equity interests in certain subsidiaries, subject to customary exclusions. The 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility is expected to continue to fund the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. The interest rate continues to be subject to adjustment based on the joint venture’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). If HIP obtains an 63 investment grade credit rating, as defined in the amended credit agreement, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The joint venture is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement that include financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as EBITDA to cash interest expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The amended credit agreement includes a secured leverage ratio test not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for so long as the facilities remain secured. HIP is in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2018, and its financial covenants do not currently impact its ability to issue indebtedness to fund future capital expenditures. At December 31, 2018, HIP’s revolving credit facility was undrawn and borrowings under the Term Loan A facility amounted to $197.5 million, excluding deferred issuance costs. Hess Midstream Partners (the Partnership): The Partnership has a $300 million 4-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility through March 2021 that can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund operating activities and capital expenditures of the Partnership. Borrowings on the credit facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.275%. The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the Partnership’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to EBITDA. If the Partnership obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time. The Partnership is subject to customary covenants in the credit agreement, including financial covenants that generally require a leverage ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters. The credit facility is secured by first priority perfected liens on substantially all directly owned assets of the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including equity interests in subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exclusions. Outstanding borrowings under this credit facility are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. At December 31, 2018, this facility was undrawn. 9. Asset Retirement Obligations The following table describes changes to and maturity of our asset retirement obligations: 2018 2017 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $ 801 $ 2,128 Liabilities incurred 68 62 Liabilities settled or disposed of (46 ) (1,464 ) Accretion expense 37 97 Revisions of estimated liabilities 1 (54 ) Foreign currency remeasurement (4 ) 32 Balance at December 31 $ 857 $ 801 Total Asset Retirement Obligations at December 31: Current portion of asset retirement obligations $ 116 $ 48 Long-term asset retirement obligations 741 753 Total at December 31 $ 857 $ 801 The liabilities incurred in 2018 include $25 million related to acquired participating interests. The liabilities settled or disposed of in 2017 primarily relate to the sale of our interests in Norway and Equatorial Guinea. The fair value of sinking fund deposits that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations, which are reported in non-current Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $148 million at December 31, 2018 (2017: $118 million). 64 10. Retirement Plans We have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a significant portion of our employees. In addition, we have an unfunded supplemental pension plan covering certain employees, which provides incremental payments that would have been payable from our principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded postretirement medical plan that provides health benefits to certain qualified retirees from ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement plans is December 31. The following table summarizes the benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of our pension and postretirement medical plans: Funded Unfunded Postretirement Pension Plans Pension Plan Medical Plan 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In millions) Change in Benefit Obligation Balance at January 1, $ 2,765 $ 2,560 $ 249 $ 256 $ 87 $ 84 Service cost 30 36 12 13 2 4 Interest cost 84 93 7 9 3 3 Actuarial (gains) loss (a) (237 ) 138 (29 ) 10 (24 ) 3 Benefit payments (b) (110 ) (113 ) (19 ) (39 ) (7 ) (7 ) Plan curtailments (10 ) (3 ) (4 ) — (2 ) — Plan amendments 4 — — — — — Foreign currency exchange rate changes (34 ) 54 — — — — Balance at December 31, (c) 2,492 2,765 216 249 59 87 Change in Fair Value of Plan Assets Balance at January 1, $ 2,732 $ 2,284 $ — $ — $ — $ — Actual return on plan assets (77 ) 351 — — — — Employer contributions 59 158 19 39 7 7 Benefit payments (b) (110 ) (113 ) (19 ) (39 ) (7 ) (7 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes (36 ) 52 — — — — Balance at December 31, 2,568 2,732 — — — — Funded Status (Plan assets greater (less) than benefit obligations) at December 31, $ 76 $ (33 ) $ (216 ) $ (249 ) $ (59 ) $ (87 ) Unrecognized Net Actuarial (Gains) Losses $ 778 $ 789 $ 47 $ 84 $ (32 ) $ (10 ) (a) The change in discount rate in 2018 resulted in total actuarial gains of approximately $235 million (2017: $170 million of actuarial losses). (b) Benefit payments include lump-sum settlement payments of approximately $32 million in 2018 (2017: $57 million). (c) At December 31, 2018, the accumulated benefit obligation for the funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans was $2,424 million and $171 million, respectively (2017: $2,679 million and $190 million, respectively). Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31 consisted of the following: Funded Unfunded Postretirement Pension Plans Pension Plan Medical Plan 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In millions) Noncurrent assets $ 76 $ 22 $ — $ — $ — $ — Current liabilities — — (30 ) (18 ) (9 ) (11 ) Noncurrent liabilities — (55 ) (186 ) (231 ) (50 ) (76 ) Pension assets / (accrued benefit liability) $ 76 $ (33 ) $ (216 ) $ (249 ) $ (59 ) $ (87 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss, pre-tax (a) $ 778 $ 789 $ 47 $ 84 $ (32 ) $ (10 ) (a) The after‑tax deficit reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was $581 million at December 31, 2018 (2017: $548 million deficit). 65 The net periodic benefit cost for funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, is as follows: Pension Plans Postretirement Medical Plan 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Service cost $ 42 $ 49 $ 60 $ 2 $ 4 $ 4 Interest cost 91 102 107 3 3 3 Expected return on plan assets (194 ) (168 ) (166 ) — — — Amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses (gains) 39 58 60 (2 ) — — Settlement loss 4 19 — — — — Curtailment gain — — — (2 ) — — Special termination benefit recognized — — 1 — — — Net Periodic Benefit Cost (a) $ (18 ) $ 60 $ 62 $ 1 $ 7 $ 7 (a) Net non-service pension costs are included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2018, net non-service pension costs amounted to income of $61 million (2017: $14 million of expense; 2016: $5 million of expense). In 2018, we recorded curtailment gains of $14 million to Accumulated other comprehensive Income (loss) and $2 million to the Statement of Consolidated Income following workforce reductions. In connection with this curtailment, as required under accounting standards, we remeasured our U.S. retirement plans and recorded a total decrease of $125 million in the Corporation’s U.S. post retirement liabilities. This reduction was primarily driven by a change in weighted average discount rates used to measure the liabilities. There was no change to the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. For the full year 2019, we forecast pension service costs for our pension and postretirement medical plans to be approximately $40 million and net non-service pension costs of approximately $40 million of income, which is comprised of interest cost of approximately $95 million, amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses of approximately $45 million, and estimated expected return on plan assets of approximately $180 million. Assumptions: The weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine Benefit obligations at December 31 and Net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended December 31 for our funded and unfunded pension plans were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Benefit Obligations: Discount rate 3.9 % 3.3 % 3.7 % Rate of compensation increase 3.8 % 4.5 % 4.6 % Net Periodic Benefit Cost: Discount rate Service cost 3.9 % 3.7 % 4.1 % Interest cost 3.3 % 3.7 % 4.1 % Expected return on plan assets 7.2 % 7.3 % 7.4 % Rate of compensation increase 4.5 % 4.6 % 4.5 % The actuarial assumptions used to determine Benefit obligations at December 31 for the postretirement medical plan were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Discount rate 3.9 % 3.2 % 3.5 % Initial health care trend rate 6.9 % 7.3 % 7.7 % Ultimate trend rate 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2038 2038 2038 The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year‑end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. Beginning in 2018, we have elected to use a split discount rate approach for all of our retirement plans. This involves the continued use of a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation, and separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of service cost and interest cost. In contrast, historically, a single weighted-average discount rate was used in both the calculation of the projected benefit obligation, and service cost and interest cost. The overall expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular 66 asset categories. Our investment strategy is to maximize long‑term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes. Asset classes and target allocations are determined by our investment committee and include domestic and foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities issued by us unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets are highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements. The current target allocations for plan assets are 50% equity securities, 30% fixed income securities (including cash and short‑term investment funds) and 20% to all other types of investments. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target levels. Fair value: The following tables provide the fair value of the financial assets of the funded pension plans at December 31, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with the fair value measurement hierarchy described in Note 1, Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies.

(b) Primarily consists of securities issued by governmental agencies and municipalities. (c) Comprised of U.S. residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. (d) Includes certain investments that have been valued using the net asset value practical expedient, and therefore have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The inclusion of such amounts in the above table is intended to aid reconciliation of investments categorized in the fair value hierarchy to total pension plan assets. 67 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following describes the financial assets of the funded pension plans: Cash and short‑term investment funds - Consists of cash on hand and short-term investment funds that provide for daily investments and redemptions. Cash on hand is classified as Level 1 and short‑term investment funds are classified as Level 2. Equities - Consists of individually held or commingled funds of U.S. and International equity securities. Equity securities, which are individually held and are traded actively on exchanges, are classified as Level 1. Commingled funds, consisting primarily of equity securities, are valued using the net asset value (NAV) per fund share derived from quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. These funds are classified as Level 2 where they have readily determinable fair values, otherwise they are classified under the NAV practical expedient. Fixed income investments - Consists of securities issued by the U.S. government, non‑U.S. governments, governmental agencies, municipalities and corporations, and agency and non-agency mortgage‑backed securities. This investment category also includes commingled investment funds that invest in fixed income securities. Individual fixed income securities are generally priced based on evaluated prices from independent pricing services, which are monitored and provided by the third-party custodial firm responsible for safekeeping plan assets. Individual fixed income securities are classified as Level 2. Certain fixed income investments are commingled funds that are valued at the NAV per fund share derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices in less liquid markets of the underlying securities. These funds are classified as Level 2 where they have readily determinable fair values, otherwise they are classified under the NAV practical expedient. Other investments - Consists of exchange‑traded real estate investment trust securities, which are classified as Level 1. Commingled funds and limited partnership investments in hedge funds, private equity and real estate funds are valued at the NAV per fund share derived using information provided by fund managers which include various inputs such as discounted future cash flows, market based comparable data and independent appraisals from third parties. These funds are classified as Level 2 or 3 where they have readily determinable fair values, otherwise they are classified under the NAV practical expedient. The following tables provide changes in financial assets that are measured at fair value based on Level 3 inputs that are held by institutional funds classified as: Fixed Real Estate Income Funds Total (In millions) Balance at January 1, 2017 $ 2 $ 8 $ 10 Actual return on plan assets — — — Purchases, sales or other settlements 1 (6 ) (5 ) Net transfers in (out) of Level 3 (1 ) — (1 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 2 2 4 Actual return on plan assets — 1 1 Purchases, sales or other settlements (2 ) 58 56 Net transfers in (out) of Level 3 — — — Balance at December 31, 2018 $ — $ 61 $ 61 Contributions and estimated future benefit payments: We expect to contribute approximately $40 million to our funded pension plans in 2019. Estimated future benefit payments by the funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, which reflect expected future service, are as follows (in millions): 2019 $ 142 2020 139 2021 135 2022 139 2023 140 Years 2024 to 2028 722 We also have several defined contribution plans for certain eligible employees. Employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to these plans and we match a portion of the employee contributions. We recorded expense of $19 million in 2018 for contributions to these plans (2017: $22 million; 2016: $25 million). 68 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 11. Share-based Compensation We have established and maintain a Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP), as amended, for the granting of restricted common shares (Restricted stock), performance share units (PSUs) and stock options to our employees. At December 31, 2018, the total number of authorized common stock under the LTIP, as amended, was 51.5 million shares, of which we have 19.0 million shares available for issuance. Share‑based compensation expense consisted of the following: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Restricted stock $ 40 $ 56 $ 45 Stock options 10 9 7 Performance share units 22 21 21 Share-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 72 $ 86 $ 73 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation expense $ — $ 1 $ 28 Based on share‑based compensation awards outstanding at December 31, 2018, unearned compensation expense, before income taxes, will be recognized in future years as follows (in millions): 2019: $57, 2020: $30 and 2021: $6. Our share-based compensation plans can be summarized as follows: Restricted stock: Restricted stock generally vests equally on an annual basis over a three-year term and are valued based on the prevailing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The following is a summary of restricted stock award activity in 2018: Shares of Restricted Common Stock Weighted - Average Price on Date of Grant (In thousands, except per share amounts) Outstanding at January 1, 2018 3,202 $ 54.04 Granted 1,258 50.78 Vested (a) (1,099 ) 65.80 Forfeited (480 ) 50.63 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 2,881 $ 48.70 (a) In 2018, restricted stock with fair values of $54 million were vested (2017: $37 million; 2016: $41 million). PSUs: PSUs generally vest three years from the date of grant and are valued based on the prevailing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The number of shares of common stock to be issued under a PSU agreement is based on a comparison of the Corporation’s total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies over a three‑year performance period ending December 31 of the year prior to settlement of the grant. Payouts of the performance share awards will range from 0% to 200% of the target awards based on the Corporation’s TSR ranking within the peer group. Dividend equivalents for the performance period will accrue on performance shares, but will only be paid out on earned shares after the performance period. The following is a summary of PSU activity in 2018: Performance Share Units Weighted - Average Fair Value on Date of Grant (In thousands, except per share amounts) Outstanding at January 1, 2018 1,146 $ 58.78 Granted 278 59.65 Vested (a) (313 ) 76.64 Forfeited (48 ) 53.62 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 1,063 $ 53.98 (a) In 2018, PSU’s with fair value of $9 million were vested (2017: $10 million; 2016: $15 million). The following weighted average assumptions were utilized to estimate the fair value of PSU awards: 2018 2017 2016 Risk free interest rate 2.39 % 1.55 % 0.96 % Stock price volatility 0.400 0.387 0.329 Contractual term in years 3.0 3.0 3.0 Grant date price of Hess common stock $ 48.48 $ 51.03 $ 44.31 69 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Stock options: Stock options vest over three years from the date of grant, have a 10‑year term, and the exercise price equals market price of the common stock on the date of grant. The following is a summary of stock options activity in 2018: Number of options (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term Outstanding at January 1, 2018 6,482 $ 66.84 3.6 years Granted 683 48.48 Exercised (564 ) 55.84 Forfeited (1,431 ) 80.23 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 5,170 $ 61.91 4.3 years At December 31, 2018, there were 5.2 million outstanding stock options (3.9 million exercisable) with a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.3 years (2.9 years for exercisable options) and an aggregated intrinsic value of 0 (0 for exercisable options). The following weighted average assumptions were utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options: 2018 2017 2016 Risk free interest rate 2.74 % 2.17 % 1.47 % Stock price volatility 0.322 0.333 0.326 Dividend yield 2.06 % 1.96 % 2.26 % Expected life in years 6.0 6.0 6.0 Weighted average fair value per option granted $ 13.69 $ 14.51 $ 11.33 In estimating the fair value of PSUs and stock options, the risk-free interest rate is based on the vesting period of the award and is obtained from published sources. The stock price volatility is determined from the historical stock prices of the Corporation using the expected term. 12. Exit and Disposal Costs In 2018, we incurred severance expense of $38 million (2017: $18 million; 2016: $55 million) and paid accrued severance costs of $40 million (2017: $48 million; 2016: $52 million). The severance expenses incurred during the three-year period resulted from asset sales and cost savings initiatives in response to low crude oil prices. Severance charges were based on amounts incurred under ongoing severance arrangements or other statutory requirements, plus amounts earned under enhanced benefit arrangements. We recognized the expense associated with the enhanced benefits ratably over the estimated service period required for the employee to earn the benefit upon termination. We also recorded charges for vacated office space of $73 million in 2018 (2017: $14 million). At December 31, 2018, we had accrued liabilities for severance costs of $4 million (2017: $6 million) and accrued liabilities for exit cost provisions of $85 million (2017: $28 million). Accrued severance costs are expected to be paid in 2019, and accrued exit costs will be paid over the next several years. 13. Impairment 2017: In the third quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $2,503 million ($550 million after income taxes) to impair the carrying value of our interests in Norway based on an anticipated sale of the asset, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 3, Dispositions. In the fourth quarter, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the Stampede Field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the Tubular Bells Field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The Stampede Field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the Pony discovery prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. The fourth quarter impairment charges were based on a total fair value estimate of approximately $1.1 billion that was determined using internal projected discounted cash flows. The determination of projected discounted cash flows depended on estimates of oil and gas reserves, future prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, discount rate and timing of future net cash flows. 2016: We recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $67 million ($21 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interest) to impair older specification rail cars in our Midstream segment based on estimated salvage values, which approximated fair value. Each of the valuation methods used in the determination of the impairment charges above represent Level 3 fair value measurements. 70 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 14. Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of: 2018 2017 2016 (a) (In millions) United States Federal Current $ 1 $ (23 ) $ (27 ) Deferred taxes and other accruals (74 ) (6 ) 1,948 State (45 ) — 23 (118 ) (29 ) 1,944 Foreign Current (b) 455 179 36 Deferred taxes and other accruals (2 ) (1,987 ) 235 453 (1,808 ) 271 Total 335 (1,837 ) 2,215 Adjustment of deferred taxes for foreign income tax law changes — — 7 Total Provision (Benefit) For Income Taxes $ 335 $ (1,837 ) $ 2,222 (a) Includes charges of $3,749 million to establish valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets. (b) Primarily comprised of Libya in 2018 and 2017. Income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) United States (a) $ (219 ) $ (2,784 ) $ (2,431 ) Foreign 439 (2,994 ) (1,423 ) Total Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ 220 $ (5,778 ) $ (3,854 ) (a) Includes substantially all of our interest expense, corporate expense and the results of commodity hedging activities. The difference between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate is reconciled below: 2018 2017 2016 U.S. statutory rate 21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Effect of foreign operations (a) 141.2 17.4 4.6 State income taxes, net of Federal income tax (18.9 ) — 1.9 Change in enacted tax laws (b) — (23.6 ) (0.2 ) Valuation allowance adjustment with tax law change (b) — 23.6 — Rate differential on U.S. loss — (4.1 ) — Gains on asset sales, net — (2.2 ) — Impairment — — (2.1 ) Valuation allowance on current year operations 55.2 (14.9 ) — Valuation allowance against previously benefitted deferred tax assets — 0.1 (97.3 ) Noncontrolling interest in partnership (15.9 ) 0.8 0.5 Intraperiod allocation (37.3 ) — — Equity compensation shortfall 6.3 (0.3 ) — Other 0.8 — (0.1 ) Total 152.4 % 31.8 % (57.7 ) % (a) The variance in effective income tax rates attributable to the effect of foreign operations primarily resulted from the mix of income among high, primarily Libya, and low tax rate jurisdictions. (b) The enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided for a decrease in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and a change to a territorial tax regime, resulting in a net $1,336 million reduction to our U.S. net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017, with a corresponding reduction in the previously established U.S. valuation allowance. 71 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The components of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets at December 31 were as follows: 2018 2017 (In millions) Deferred Tax Liabilities Property, plant and equipment and investments $ (853 ) $ (629 ) Other (77 ) (24 ) Total Deferred Tax Liabilities (930 ) (653 ) Deferred Tax Assets Net operating loss carryforwards 4,239 4,029 Tax credit carryforwards 134 138 Property, plant and equipment and investments 416 746 Accrued compensation, deferred credits and other liabilities 232 283 Asset retirement obligations 225 212 Other 161 36 Total Deferred Tax Assets 5,407 5,444 Valuation allowances (a) (4,877 ) (5,199 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 530 245 Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) $ (400 ) $ (408 ) (a) In 2018, the valuation allowance decreased by $322 million (2017: decrease of $251 million; 2016: increase of $3,872). In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted by taxing jurisdiction and are recorded at December 31 as follows: 2018 2017 (In millions) Deferred income taxes (long-term asset) $ 21 $ 21 Deferred income taxes (long-term liability) (421 ) (429 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) $ (400 ) $ (408 ) At December 31, 2018, we have recognized a gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards of $4,239 million before application of valuation allowances. The deferred tax asset is comprised of $1,382 million attributable to foreign net operating losses which begin to expire in 2025, $2,386 million attributable to U.S. Federal operating losses which begin to expire in 2035, and $471 million attributable to losses in various U.S. states which begin to expire in 2019. The deferred tax asset attributable to foreign net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, is $12 million. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to U.S. Federal and state net operating losses. At December 31, 2018, we have U.S. Federal, state and foreign alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $49 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely, and approximately $15 million of other business credit carryforwards. The deferred tax asset attributable to these credits, net of valuation allowances, is $1 million. A full valuation allowance is established against our foreign tax credit carryforwards of $70 million, which begin to expire in 2019. At December 31, 2018, the Balance Sheet reflects a $4,877 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on application of the relevant accounting standards. Hess continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia, and Guyana. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. The cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ending December 31, 2018 constitutes significant objective negative evidence. Such objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider subjective positive evidence, such as our projections of future taxable income, resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for these jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence. The Company completed its review of previously recorded provisional income tax amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”) and concluded that additional information, interpretation and guidance that became available during the twelve-month measurement period did not alter the Company’s accounting as reported in its Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017. There were no adjustments deemed necessary in the period ended December 31, 2018. 72 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Below is a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $ 205 $ 424 $ 604 Additions based on tax positions taken in the current year 19 14 19 Additions based on tax positions of prior years 36 4 113 Reductions based on tax positions of prior years (78 ) (147 ) (274 ) Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities (10 ) (85 ) (27 ) Reductions due to lapses in statutes of limitation (4 ) (5 ) (11 ) Balance at December 31 $ 168 $ 205 $ 424 The December 31, 2018 balance of unrecognized tax benefits includes $7 million that, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between $2 million and $8 million due to settlements with taxing authorities or other resolutions, as well as lapses in statutes of limitation. At December 31, 2018, our accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is $3 million (2017: $23 million). We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to examinations by income tax authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2005. 15. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share The Net income (loss) and weighted average number of common shares used in basic and diluted earnings per share computation were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Common Stockholders: Net income (loss) $ (115 ) $ (3,941 ) $ (6,076 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 167 133 56 Less: Preferred stock dividends 46 46 41 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation Common Stockholders $ (328 ) $ (4,120 ) $ (6,173 ) Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding: Basic 298.2 314.1 309.9 Effect of dilutive securities Restricted common stock — — — Stock options — — — Performance share units — — — Mandatory Convertible Preferred stock — — — Diluted 298.2 314.1 309.9 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation per Common Share: Basic $ (1.10 ) $ (13.12 ) $ (19.92 ) Diluted $ (1.10 ) $ (13.12 ) $ (19.92 ) Antidilutive shares excluded from the computation of diluted shares: Restricted common stock 2.9 3.3 3.3 Stock options 5.5 6.4 6.9 Performance share units 1.1 0.6 0.9 Common shares from conversion of preferred stock 12.7 12.8 11.2 73 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 16.

The dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock are payable on a cumulative basis. Unless converted earlier, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert into between 21.822 shares and 25.642 shares of our common stock based on the volume weighted average share price (“VWAP”) over a period of twenty-consecutive trading days ending January 28, 2019, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. See Note 15, Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share and Note 22, Subsequent Event. We also entered into capped call transactions on 12.55 million covered shares that were expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock if the VWAP for any individual day during the period of twenty consecutive trading days ending January 28, 2019 exceeded $45.83 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. On any day during the twenty consecutive trading days ending January 28, 2019, if the daily VWAP is between $45.83 and $53.625, the value of the capped call transactions for that day will be the proportionate covered shares multiplied by the difference between the VWAP for that day and $45.83. The number of common shares to be delivered by the counterparties to us will be the sum of each daily calculation during the twenty-consecutive trading day period. The premium paid for the capped call transactions was $37 million, which was recorded against Capital in excess of par in the Statement of Consolidated Equity. See Note 22, Subsequent Event. Common Stock Repurchase Plan: In 2018, we repurchased 25.2 million shares of our common stock (2017: 2.6 million shares) for $1,380 million (2017: $120 million), at an average cost per share of $54.85 (2017: $45.67). There were no repurchases in 2016. At December 31, 2018, we are authorized, but not required, to purchase additional common stock up to a value of $650 million. Common stock dividends: In 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash dividends declared on common stock totaled $1.00 per share ($0.25 per quarter). 74 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 17.

Leased Assets We and certain of our subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, support vessels, office space and other assets for varying periods under contractual obligations accounted for as operating leases. Operating lease expenses for drilling rigs used to drill development wells and successful exploration wells are capitalized. At December 31, 2018, future minimum rental payments applicable to non‑cancelable operating leases with remaining terms in excess of one year (other than oil and gas property leases) are as follows (in millions): 2019 $ 355 2020 156 2021 65 2022 64 2023 64 Remaining years 198 Total Minimum Lease Payments 902 Less: Income from subleases 114 Net Minimum Lease Payments $ 788 Rental expense was as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Total rental expense $ 154 $ 123 $ 106 Less: Income from subleases 8 10 5 Net Rental Expense $ 146 $ 113 $ 101 75 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 19. Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments Guarantees and Contingencies We are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through lengthy discovery, conciliation and/or arbitration proceedings, or litigation before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters described below, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are three remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Rhode Island is proceeding in Federal court. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to Federal court by the defendants. In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and also agreed with EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the Federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages. In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. The remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. EPA has estimated that this remedy will cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected ship-building and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. We indicated to EPA that we would comply with the 76 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Administrative Order and are currently contributing funding for the Remedial Design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties. At the same time, we are participating in an allocation process whereby a neutral expert selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the Remedial Design costs to be paid by each of the participants. On September 28, 2017, we received a general notice letter and offer to settle from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency relating to Superfund claims for the Ector Drum, Inc. Superfund Site in Odessa, Texas. The EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) took clean-up and response action at the site commencing in 2014 and concluded in December 2015. The site was determined to have improperly stored industrial waste, including drums with oily liquids. The total clean-up cost incurred by the EPA was approximately $3.5 million. We were invited to negotiate a voluntary settlement for our purported share of the clean-up costs. Our share, if any, is undetermined. From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of the aforementioned proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Segment Information We currently have two operating segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Midstream. The E&P operating segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases and sells crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Production operations over the three years ended December 31, 2018 were primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the JDA and Malaysia, and from divested assets, including Equatorial Guinea (until November 2017) and Norway (until December 2017). The Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of NGLs, transportation of crude oil by rail car, terminaling and loading crude oil and NGLs, storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota. All unallocated costs are reflected under Corporate, Interest and Other.

Financial Risk Management Activities In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, corporate financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. We maintain a control environment for all of our financial risk management activities under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Corporate Financial Risk Management Activities: Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas we produce or by reducing our exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to fix the forward selling price of a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we conduct business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. At December 31, 2018, these forward contracts relate to the British Pound. Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates. Gross notional amounts of both long and short positions are presented in the volume tables beginning below. These amounts include long and short positions that offset in closed positions and have not reached contractual maturity. Gross notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but are used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts. 79 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The gross notional amounts of outstanding financial risk management derivative contracts related to WTI instruments as of the dates shown below were as follows: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Calendar year program 2019 2018 Instrument type Puts Collars Crude oil volumes (millions of barrels) 34.7 42.0 Ceiling price N/A $ 65 Floor price $ 60 $ 50 At December 31, 2017, we had WTI crude oil price collars for calendar year 2018 with a monthly floor price of $50 per barrel and a monthly ceiling price of $65 per barrel for 115,000 bopd. In the first quarter of 2018, we bought back the WTI $65 call options within the crude oil price collars for the period of May 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. In 2018, we purchased WTI put options for calendar year 2019 with a WTI monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 95,000 bopd. The gross notional amounts of outstanding financial risk management derivative contracts, excluding commodity contracts, were as follows: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (In millions) Foreign exchange $ 16 $ 52 Interest rate swaps $ 100 $ 450 The table below reflects the gross and net fair values of risk management derivative instruments and their respective financial statement caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet: Assets Liabilities (In millions) December 31, 2018 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments Commodity - Other current assets $ 484 $ — Interest rate - Other liabilities and deferred credits (noncurrent) — (2 ) Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments 484 (2 ) Gross fair value of derivative contracts 484 (2 ) Master netting arrangements — — Net Fair Value of Derivative Contracts $ 484 $ (2 ) December 31, 2017 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments Commodity - Accounts payable $ — $ (7 ) Interest rate - Other assets (noncurrent) and Accounts payable — (4 ) Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments — (11 ) Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Commodity - Accounts payable — (2 ) Foreign exchange - Accounts receivable: Joint venture and other 1 — Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments 1 (2 ) Gross fair value of derivative contracts 1 (13 ) Master netting arrangements — — Net Fair Value of Derivative Contracts $ 1 $ (13 ) All fair values above are based on Level 2 inputs. Impact on statement of consolidated income from derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments: Crude oil derivatives: In 2018, crude oil price hedging contracts decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $161 million (2017: decrease of $34 million; 2016: $0). At December 31, 2018, pre-tax deferred gains in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to outstanding crude oil price hedging contracts were $365 million, of which all will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings. 80 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: At December 31, 2018, we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $100 million (2017: $450 million), which were designated as fair value hedges and relate to debt where we have converted interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates. During 2018, we terminated interest rate swaps with a gross notional amount of $350 million and paid $3 million (2017: $0; 2016: $5 million proceeds). See Note 8, Debt. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and the hedged fixed‑rate debt are recorded in Interest expense in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2018, the change in fair value of interest rate swaps was an increase in the derivative liability of $1 million (2017: $4 million increase in liability; 2016: $6 million increase in asset) with a corresponding adjustment in the carrying value of the hedged fixed‑rate debt. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges: During 2017, HIP entered into interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts totaling $553 million to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from floating to fixed rates before settling these instruments for a payment of $3 million as part of the refinancing that occurred later in the year. See Note 8, Debt. Impact on statement of consolidated income from derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments: Crude oil collars: In 2018, noncash adjustments to de-designated crude oil price hedging contracts decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $22 million (2017: decrease of $25 million). Foreign exchange: Total foreign exchange gains and losses were a loss of $5 million in 2018 (2017: gain of $15 million; 2016: gain of $26 million) and are reported in Other, net in Revenues and non-operating income in the Statement of Consolidated Income. A component of foreign exchange gains or losses is the result of foreign exchange derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges, which amounted to a loss of $2 million in 2018 (2017: gain of $3 million; 2016: gain of $62 million). After‑tax foreign currency translation adjustments included in the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income amounted to gains of $144 million in 2017 and $56 million in 2016. In 2017, $900 million of cumulative currency translation losses were recognized in earnings as a result of the sale of our assets in Norway. See Note 3, Dispositions. Credit Risk: We are exposed to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, groups of counterparties or customers. Accounts receivable are generated from a diverse domestic and international customer base. At December 31, 2018, our Accounts receivable were concentrated with the following counterparty industry segments: Financial Institutions — 34%, Integrated companies — 24%, Independent E&P companies — 22%, National oil companies — 7% Refining and marketing companies — 5%, Storage and transportation companies — 3%, and Others — 5%. We reduce risk related to certain counterparties, where applicable, by using master netting arrangements and requiring collateral, generally cash or letters of credit. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $284 million (2017: $246 million). Fair Value Measurement: At December 31, 2018, outstanding total debt, excluding capital leases, was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments with a carrying value of $6,403 million and a fair value of $6,225 million, based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. We also have short-term financial instruments, primarily cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, for which the carrying value approximated fair value at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 22. Subsequent Event On January 31, 2019, the 8.00% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock) automatically converted into shares of common stock at a rate of 21.822 shares of common stock per share of Preferred Stock. In total, the Preferred Stock was converted into approximately 12.5 million shares of common stock. In connection with the Preferred Stock offering in 2016, the Company entered into capped call transactions to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, subject to a cap. The Company received approximately 0.9 million shares of common stock upon settlement of the capped call transactions. As a result, the net number of common shares issued by the Company upon conversion of the Preferred Stock was approximately 11.6 million shares. 81 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DATA (UNAUDITED) The Supplementary Oil and Gas Data that follows is presented in accordance with ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities, and includes (1) costs incurred, capitalized costs and results of operations relating to oil and gas producing activities, (2) net proved oil and gas reserves and (3) a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves, including a reconciliation of changes therein. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, we produced crude oil, NGLs and natural gas principally in the United States (U.S.), Europe (Norway until December 2017 and Denmark), Africa (Equatorial Guinea until November 2017 and Libya) and Asia and Other (the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), and Malaysia). Exploration activities were also conducted, or are planned, in certain of these areas as well as additional countries. See Note 3, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Proved oil and gas reserves are quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by our internal teams of geoscience and reservoir engineering professionals. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007).” The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir, the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate, the stage of reservoir development and the production history. Where applicable, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC regulations. These technologies, including computational methods, must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In order for reserves to be classified as proved, any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project, either senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the development. Our proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10‑K. Internal Controls The Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation processes, which are administered by our Global Reserves group and our Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff who work directly with the oil and gas properties using industry standard reserve estimation principles, definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates of the Corporation’s assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an independent third-party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves (see pages 85 through 90). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors. Qualifications The person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves during 2018 was Mr. Kenneth Kosco, Senior Manager, Global Reserves. Mr. Kosco is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a BS degree in Petroleum Engineering. His experience has been primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas. Mr. Kosco is responsible for the Corporation’s Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization responsible for establishing the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews. Reserves Audit We engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 80% of 2018 year‑end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (2017: 80%). The purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D&M letter report, dated February 6, 2019, on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry. D&M is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. D&M’s letter report on the Corporation’s December 31, 2018 oil 84 and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this Form 10‑K. While the D&M report should be read in its entirety, the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M, the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and audited by D&M, in the aggregate, differed by less than 1% (2017: 4%) of total audited net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The report also includes among other information, the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve audit. Crude Oil Prices Used to Estimate Proved Reserves Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period before December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2018 were $65.55 per barrel for WTI (2017: $51.19; 2016: $42.68) and $72.08 per barrel for Brent (2017: $54.87; 2016: $44.45). New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were $3.01 per mcf in 2018 (2017: $3.03; 2016: $2.54). At December 31, 2018, spot prices for WTI oil closed at $45.41 per barrel. If crude oil prices during 2019 average below those used in determining 2018 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2019, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing cost structures. Conversely, if crude oil prices in 2019 remain above those used in determining 2018 proved reserves, we could recognize positive revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2019. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2019, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2019 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2019 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. 85 Following are the Corporation’s proved reserves: Crude Oil & Condensate Natural Gas Liquids United States Europe (b) Africa Asia & Other Total United States Europe (b) Asia & Other Total (Millions of bbls) (Millions of bbls) Net Proved Reserves At January 1, 2016 346 203 172 5 726 74 27 — 101 Revisions of previous estimates (a) 42 (14 ) 2 1 31 23 (19 ) — 4 Extensions, discoveries and other additions 12 33 — — 45 5 — — 5 Sales of minerals in place — — — — — — — — — Production (45 ) (12 ) (12 ) (1 ) (70 ) (16 ) — — (16 ) At December 31, 2016 355 210 162 5 732 86 8 — 94 Revisions of previous estimates (a) 13 5 (6 ) — 12 56 — — 56 Extensions, discoveries and other additions 127 2 — 45 174 50 — — 50 Sales of minerals in place (21 ) (158 ) (15 ) — (194 ) (6 ) (8 ) — (14 ) Production (41 ) (10 ) (13 ) (1 ) (65 ) (15 ) — — (15 ) At December 31, 2017 433 49 128 49 659 171 — — 171 Revisions of previous estimates (a) (3 ) (10 ) (2 ) (2 ) (17 ) (14 ) — — (14 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 114 2 7 2 125 39 — — 39 Purchase of minerals in place 3 — — — 3 1 — — 1 Sales of minerals in place (3 ) — — — (3 ) (8 ) — — (8 ) Production (43 ) (2 ) (7 ) (1 ) (53 ) (14 ) — — (14 ) At December 31, 2018 501 39 126 48 714 175 — — 175 Net Proved Developed Reserves At January 1, 2016 253 114 148 5 520 51 12 — 63 At December 31, 2016 245 116 138 5 504 59 3 — 62 At December 31, 2017 239 45 112 5 401 87 — — 87 At December 31, 2018 266 38 111 4 419 85 — — 85 Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 1, 2016 93 89 24 — 206 23 15 — 38 At December 31, 2016 110 94 24 — 228 27 5 — 32 At December 31, 2017 194 4 16 44 258 84 — — 84 At December 31, 2018 235 1 15 44 295 90 — — 90 (a) Revisions resulting from the impact of price changes in production sharing contracts reduced proved crude oil and condensate reserves in 2018 by 3 million, primarily in Guyana.

Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 207 million boe (122 million barrels of crude oil, 39 million barrels of NGLs and 274 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 89. 2017: Total Additions were 291 million boe, of which 11 million boe (4 million barrels of crude oil, 1 million barrels of NGLs and 37 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken and North Malay Basin. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 280 million boe (170 million barrels of crude oil, 49 million barrels of NGLs and 365 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 89. 2016: Total Additions were 69 million boe, of which 45 million boe (34 million barrels of crude oil, 2 million barrels of NGLs and 55 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken and from a 20-year extension to the license for the South Arne Field, offshore Denmark, which extends expiry to 2047. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 24 million boe (11 million barrels of crude oil, 3 million barrels of NGLs and 59 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 89. Revisions of previous estimates 2018: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net decrease of 41 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 3 million boe (crude oil - 4 million barrels increase, NGLs - 4 million barrels decrease and natural gas - 20 million mcf increase). Revisions to proved developed reserves primarily relate to the Bakken. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 89. 2017: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net increase of 106 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 126 million boe (41 million barrels of crude oil, 44 million barrels of NGLs and 243 million mcf of natural gas). Revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken amounted to 85 million boe with approximately 55% resulting from improved reservoir performance, and the remaining 45% resulting from higher prices and an improved cost structure. The Gulf of Mexico and Utica had positive revisions to proved developed reserves totaling 16 million boe due to improved reservoir performance, while higher crude oil prices resulted in revisions to proved developed reserves of 15 million boe in Denmark and Utica. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 89. 2016: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net increase of 74 million boe, of which net positive revisions increased proved reserves by 103 million boe (54 million barrels of crude oil, 5 million barrels of NGLs and 265 million mcf of natural gas) and negative revisions associated with lower crude oil prices reduced proved reserves by 29 million boe (23 million barrels of crude oil, 1 million barrels of NGLs and 30 million mcf of natural gas). Total revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 41 million boe (5 million barrels decrease of crude oil, 7 million barrels increase of NGLs and 235 million mcf increase of natural gas) reflecting improved expected recoveries in the Bakken, completion of incremental development activities at the North Malay Basin, partially offset by negative revisions at the Valhall Field offshore Norway due to changes in estimated recoveries of NGLs and natural gas, and negative price revisions mostly related to crude oil reserves. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 89. Sales of minerals in place (‘Asset sales’) 2018: Assets sales primarily include our former interests in the Utica Basin of Ohio. 2017: Assets sales primarily include our former interests in Norway, Equatorial Guinea, and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin. 88 Proved Undeveloped Reserves Following are the Corporation’s proved undeveloped reserves: United States Europe Africa Asia & Other Total (Millions of boe) Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 1, 2016 139 122 26 4 291 Revisions of previous estimates 50 (14 ) — (3 ) 33 Extensions, discoveries and other additions 13 11 — — 24 Transfers to proved developed reserves (34 ) (4 ) — — (38 ) Sales of minerals in place — — — — — At December 31, 2016 168 115 26 1 310 Revisions of previous estimates (8 ) (3 ) (9 ) — (20 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 209 3 — 68 280 Transfers to proved developed reserves (32 ) — — — (32 ) Sales of minerals in place — (109 ) — — (109 ) At December 31, 2017 337 6 17 69 429 Revisions of previous estimates (22 ) (7 ) (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 178 2 8 19 207 Transfers to proved developed reserves (97 ) — (2 ) — (99 ) Sales of minerals in place (7 ) — — — (7 ) At December 31, 2018 389 1 17 79 486 Extensions, discoveries and other additions (‘Additions’) 2018: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 168 million boe, of which approximately 40% of the change results from additional planned wells to be drilled in the next five years, approximately 35% results from performance associated with improved well completion designs, and approximately 25% results from other changes, primarily the impact of higher crude oil prices. Additions in the Gulf of Mexico were 10 million boe due to additional planned drilling at the Tubular Bells Field. Additions in Asia include 11 million boe at North Malay Basin and 8 million boe at the JDA relating to additional planned wells to be drilled within the next five years. 2017: In the United States, additions from the Bakken were 180 million boe, of which approximately 70% resulted from higher crude oil prices that increased the percentage of proved undeveloped wells in our planned five-year drilling program compared to the prior year. The remaining 30% of Bakken additions reflect the expected improved recovery in future wells from changes in well completion design and reservoir performance. Additions from the Stampede Field in the Gulf of Mexico were 21 million boe, due to completion of further development activities. At the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, additions of 45 million boe were recognized for project sanction of the first phase of the Liza Field development. Other international additions were primarily at North Malay Basin due to higher prices. 2016: In the United States, additions were at the Utica shale play in Ohio as result of changes in well design that improved both well economics and recoverability, and at the Bakken due to drilling plans. In Europe, additions were primarily from a 20-year extension to the license for the South Arne Field, offshore Denmark, which extends expiry to 2047. Revisions of previous estimates 2018: Negative reserve revisions in the United States totaling 22 million boe, primarily resulted from optimizing drilling plans at the Bakken. Negative reserve revisions in international assets primarily resulted from updates in drilling plans in Denmark and North Malay Basin, and the impact of crude oil price changes on our PSC in Guyana. 2017: Total negative reserve revisions of 20 million boe, primarily relate to changes in drilling plans in Libya and lower reserves at certain fields in the Gulf of Mexico and Denmark. 2016: Total positive reserve revisions were 33 million boe. Technical revisions increased reserves by 44 million boe and were primarily from an improved well design at the Bakken, which was partially offset by negative revisions at the Valhall Field offshore Norway due to changes in expected recoveries of NGLs and natural gas. Negative revisions resulting from lower commodity prices totaled 11 million boe and were primarily in the Bakken. 89 Transfers to proved developed reserves (‘Transfers’) 2018: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 75 million boe in the Bakken shale play associated with drilling activity, and 22 million boe at the Stampede Field in the Gulf of Mexico where first production was achieved in 2018. 2017: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 24 million boe in the Bakken and 8 million boe at the Penn State Field in the Gulf of Mexico associated with drilling activity. 2016: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 21 million boe in the Bakken and 13 million boe at the Tubular Bells and Conger Fields in the Gulf of Mexico associated with drilling activity. In 2018, capital expenditures of $1,070 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (2017: $527 million; 2016: $589 million). Projects that have proved reserves, which have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess of five years, total 6 million boe, or 1% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2018. Most of the proved undeveloped reserves in excess of five years relate to Libya. Production Sharing Contracts The Corporation’s proved reserves include crude oil and natural gas reserves relating to long‑term agreements with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the legal right to produce or has a revenue interest in the production. Proved reserves from these production sharing contracts for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018 are presented separately below, as well as volumes produced and received during 2018, 2017 and 2016 from these production sharing contracts.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves Future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining year‑end reserve estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development and production costs, which are based on year‑end costs and existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year‑end statutory tax rates to the pre‑tax net cash flows, as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%. The prices used for the discounted future net cash flows in 2018 were $65.55 per barrel for WTI (2017: $51.19; 2016: $42.68) and $72.08 per barrel for Brent (2017: $54.87; 2016: $44.45) and do not include the effects of commodity hedges. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were $3.01 per mcf in 2018 (2017: $3.03; 2016: $2.54). Selling prices have in the past, and can in the future, fluctuate significantly. As a result, selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices. In addition, the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The amount of tax deductions, credits, and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves, variances in actual pre-tax cash flows from forecasted pre-tax cash flows in historical periods, and the impact to year-end carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the Corporation’s income tax returns exploration expenses, interest expense, and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not contemplated 90 in the standardized measure computations. The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Based upon their evaluation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2018, John B. Hess, Chief Executive Officer, and John P. Rielly, Chief Financial Officer, concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018. There was no change in internal controls over financial reporting identified in the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report on the Corporation’s internal controls over financial reporting are included in",2023-12-30 22:19:35.831658
4447,HES,HESS CORP,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 18 Catastrophic and other events, whether naturally occurring or man‑made, may materially affect our operations and financial condition. Our oil and gas operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry, including catastrophic events, which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations, result in personal injury and have other significant adverse effects. These events include unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations, equipment malfunctions or failures, fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, hurricanes, severe weather, geological events, shortages in availability of skilled labor or cyber‑attacks. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent, including for property and casualty losses. There can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Political or regulatory developments and governmental actions, including Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions; expropriation or nationalization of property; mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights; imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds; changes in import and export regulations; reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel; the imposition of tariffs, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities; prohibition on hydraulic fracturing of wells; and anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, may adversely affect our operations and those of our counterparties with whom we have contracted, which may affect our financial results. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involve substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk. In addition, borrowings on credit facilities may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be discontinued or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include fluctuations in interest rates or an increase in the cost of credit facility borrowings. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political instability and civil unrest in North Africa, South America and the Middle East has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. In addition, geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas, such as the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over a portion of the Stabroek Block. Political instability exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals, enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages and other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will 19 occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. Climate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change and sustainability has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of greenhouse gases. As a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels, demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced, which may have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business. In addition, certain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change, which could make it more difficult to finance our business. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, in 2017 certain municipalities and private associations in California, Rhode Island, and Maryland separately filed lawsuits against over 30 fossil fuel producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources and more diverse portfolios than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas. To a lesser extent, we are also in competition with producers of alternative fuels or other forms of energy, including wind, solar and electric power, and in the future, could face increasing competition due to the development and adoption of new technologies. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources to acquire and develop oil and gas assets. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Many of our competitors have a more diverse portfolio of assets, which may minimize the impact of adverse events occurring at any one location. Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. As part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory or other government agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions, equipment failures, and outbreaks of infectious diseases. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows. Departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. Our future success depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy. The departure of key members of senior management or an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. An inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or 20 could face an increase in cost, which may impact our ability to run our operations and deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. We engage in risk management transactions designed to mitigate commodity price volatility and other risks but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons, we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility. One of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, Hess Midstream LP. The responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities. Our control of Hess Midstream LP bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission. These heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders. Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs. Disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the Corporation or our business partners may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are an integral part of our exploration, development and production activities and the activities of our business partners. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our corporation and with outside business partners. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems or those of our business partners and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, any such disruption, failure or cyber breach and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, financial loss, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 21 Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are three remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Rhode Island is proceeding in Federal court. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to Federal court by the defendants. In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and agreed with the EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the Federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages. In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. The remedy selected by the EPA includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. The EPA’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA’s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2020. The costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by 22 private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8, the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations omits certain discussions of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018, which can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019, and such comparisons are incorporated herein by reference. Index Overview Consolidated Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Hess Corporation is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas with production operations and development activities located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), Malaysia, and Denmark. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we have announced sixteen significant discoveries. The Liza Phase 1 development achieved first production in December 2019, with peak production expected to reach up to 120,000 gross bopd. The Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned in the second quarter of 2019 and is expected to start up by early 2022 with production reaching up to 220,000 gross bopd. The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin the potential for at least five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2025. Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2019, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. See Note 6, Hess Midstream in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2020 Outlook Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are projected to be approximately $3.0 billion in 2020. Capital investment for our Midstream operations is expected to be approximately $350 million. Oil and gas net production in 2020 is forecast to be in the range of 330,000 boepd to 335,000 boepd excluding Libya, up from 290,000 boepd in 2019, excluding Libya. Currently, we have West Texas Intermediate (WTI) put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 130,000 bopd, and Brent put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 20,000 bopd. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,642 million in 2019, compared with $1,939 million in 2018, while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2,237 million in 2019 and $2,129 million in 2018. Capital expenditures for 2019 and 2018 were $2,992 million and $2,180 million, respectively. In 2020, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2019 of $1.5 billion, and our available committed revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends. Consolidated Results Net loss attributable to Hess Corporation was $408 million in 2019 (2018: $282 million). Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 30, the adjusted net loss was $281 million in 2019 (2018: $176 million). Annual net production averaged 311,000 boepd in 2019 (2018: 277,000 boepd). Total proved reserves were 1,197 million boe at December 31, 2019 (2018: 1,192 million boe). 27 Significant 2019 Activities The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2019: E&P assets: • In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken shale play averaged 152,000 boepd (2018: 117,000 boepd), with net oil production up 22% to 93,000 bopd from 76,000 bopd in the prior year, primarily due to increased drilling activity and new plug and perf completion design. Natural gas and NGL production was also higher due to the increased drilling activity, additional natural gas captured with the start-up of the Little Missouri 4 natural gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2019 and additional NGL received under percentage of proceeds contracts resulting from lower NGL commodity pricing. During the year, we operated six rigs, drilled 160 wells and brought on production 156 wells. Effective 2019, all new production wells use plug and perf completions. We were able to reduce the average cost of a plug and perf well in 2019 to $6.8 million per well from $7.6 million in 2018. During 2020, we plan to operate six rigs, drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 175 wells on production. We forecast net production to average approximately 180,000 boepd in 2020 and to reach approximately 200,000 boepd by the end of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, the Tioga Gas Plant will be shut down for approximately 45 days for a planned turnaround and tie-in of the plant expansion project which will increase gas processing capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from 250 million cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service by mid-2021. The shutdown for the turnaround is expected to reduce 2020 average net production, mostly natural gas liquids and natural gas, by approximately 6,000 boepd. Commencing in 2021, we plan to reduce our rig count to four operated rigs and, at this level of activity, expect to hold net production relatively flat at approximately 200,000 boepd for at least five years. • In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 66,000 boepd (2018: 57,000 boepd). The increase in production was primarily due to the Conger and Penn State fields and a new well brought online at the Llano Field. We forecast Gulf of Mexico net production for 2020 to average approximately 65,000 boepd, which reflects the impact of planned maintenance at the Conger and Llano fields in the second quarter. In 2019, the Corporation announced a discovery at the Hess operated Esox-1 exploration well in Mississippi Canyon Block No. 726 (Hess 57%), which encountered approximately 191 feet of net pay in high-quality oil-bearing Miocene reservoirs. First production from the well was achieved in February 2020 as a tie-back to the Tubular Bells production facilities. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the operator, Kosmos Energy Ltd., commenced drilling of the Oldfield-1 exploration well (Hess 60%), located approximately 6 miles east of Esox-1. The well, which was completed in January 2020, did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and 2019 results include $15 million in exploration expense for well costs incurred through December 31, 2019. We estimate approximately $15 million of exploration expense will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020 for well costs incurred after December 31, 2019. • At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, which covers approximately 6.6 million acres, the operator Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited has made sixteen significant discoveries since 2015. The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin the potential for at least five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2025. The Liza Phase 1 development, which was sanctioned in 2017, began producing oil in December 2019 from the Liza Destiny FPSO. Production is expected to ramp up to the full capacity of 120,000 gross bopd in 2020. We forecast net production for 2020 to average approximately 25,000 bopd. The Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned in 2019 and will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected by early 2022. Six drill centers are planned with a total of 30 wells, including 15 production wells, nine water injection wells and six gas injection wells. In 2020, the operator plans to commence development drilling, installation of subsea flow lines and equipment, and installation of topside facilities modules on the Liza Unity FPSO. A third development, at the Payara Field, is expected to be sanctioned following government and regulatory approvals and is expected to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd with startup as early as 2023. In addition to the first three developments, planning is underway for additional FPSOs. The ultimate sizing and timing of these potential developments will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling. In 2019, five successful exploration wells and three successful appraisal wells were drilled on the Stabroek Block. See detailed well results on page 9 of Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties. • In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A‑18 of the JDA averaged 35,000 boepd for the year (2018: 36,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, while net production from North Malay 28 Basin averaged 28,000 boepd for the year (2018: 27,000 boepd). During 2019, we drilled six production wells at North Malay Basin, and plan to continue the drilling program and development activities in 2020. We also expect to commence drilling activities in the fourth quarter of 2020 at the JDA. Combined net production from our JDA and North Malay Basin assets is forecast to average approximately 60,000 boepd in 2020. The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2019: • In March, Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP) completed the acquisition of Hess’ water services business for $225 million in cash. • In March, HIP and Hess Midstream Partners LP acquired crude oil and gas gathering assets, and HIP acquired water gathering assets of Summit Midstream Partners LP’s Tioga Gathering System for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $90 million, with the potential for an additional $10 million of contingent payments in future periods subject to certain future performance metrics. • The Little Missouri 4 gas processing plant, a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Midstream LP and Targa Resources Corp., was placed in service during the third quarter. • In December, Hess Midstream Partners LP completed the acquisition of HIP and converted its organizational structure from a master limited partnership into an “Up-C” structure in which Hess Midstream Partners LP’s public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares in a new public entity named Hess Midstream LP (Hess Midstream). Upon completion of the transaction, we received consideration of $301 million in cash and additional equity interests in Hess Midstream LP, resulting in Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership in Hess Midstream LP. See Note 6, Hess Midstream and Note 8, Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures In 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,642 million (2018: $1,939 million). At December 31, 2019, consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $1,545 million (2018: $2,694 million), consolidated debt was $7,142 million (2018: $6,672 million, including capital lease obligations), and our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio was 43.2% (2018: 38.0%). Hess Midstream debt, which is nonrecourse to Hess Corporation, was $1,753 million at December 31, 2019 (2018: $981 million). Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures: United States Bakken $ 1,312 $ 967 $ 624 Other Onshore 45 43 30 Total Onshore 1,357 1,010 654 Offshore 426 368 702 Total United States 1,783 1,378 1,356 Guyana 783 383 236 Europe 40 8 142 Asia and Other 137 300 313 E&P - Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 2,743 $ 2,069 $ 2,047 Exploration Expenses Charged to Income Included Above: United States $ 105 $ 106 $ 90 International 62 54 105 Total Exploration Expenses Charged to Income included above $ 167 $ 160 $ 195 Midstream Capital Expenditures: Midstream - Capital Expenditures (a) $ 416 $ 271 $ 121 (a) Excludes equity investments of $33 million in 2019 (2018: $67 million). In 2020, we project our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $3.0 billion and Midstream capital expenditures to be approximately $350 million. 29 Consolidated Results of Operations Results by Segment: The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions, except per share amounts) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation: Exploration and Production $ 53 $ 51 $ (3,653 ) Midstream 144 120 42 Corporate, Interest and Other (605 ) (453 ) (463 ) Total $ (408 ) $ (282 ) $ (4,074 ) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Per Common Share - Diluted (a) $ (1.37 ) $ (1.10 ) $ (13.12 ) (a) Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation less preferred stock dividends, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares. In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods: The following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 36 through 39. 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods, After Income Taxes: Exploration and Production $ 63 $ (86 ) $ (2,609 ) Midstream (16 ) — (34 ) Corporate, Interest and Other (174 ) (20 ) (30 ) Total $ (127 ) $ (106 ) $ (2,673 ) The following table presents the pre-tax amount of items affecting comparability of income (expense) by financial statement line item in the Statement of Consolidated Income on page 55.

Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to evaluate the Corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. 31 Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized statement of income for our E&P operations: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues $ 6,495 $ 6,323 $ 5,460 Gains (losses) on asset sales, net 22 27 (39 ) Other, net 51 53 (1 ) Total revenues and non-operating income 6,568 6,403 5,420 Costs and Expenses Marketing, including purchased oil and gas 1,849 1,833 1,335 Operating costs and expenses 971 941 1,248 Production and severance taxes 184 171 119 Midstream tariffs 722 648 543 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 233 362 507 General and administrative expenses 204 258 224 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,977 1,748 2,736 Impairment — — 4,203 Total costs and expenses 6,140 5,961 10,915 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes 428 442 (5,495 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes (a) 375 391 (1,842 ) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ 53 $ 51 $ (3,653 ) (a) Commencing January 1, 2019, management changed its measurement of segment earnings to reflect income taxes on a post U.S. tax consolidation and valuation allowance assessment basis. See footnote (a) in the table on page 86 for further details. Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 36, the changes in E&P results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, Midstream tariffs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. 32 Selling Prices: Average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 7% lower in 2019 compared with the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for NGL decreased in 2019 by 39% and worldwide natural gas prices decreased in 2019 by 7%, compared with the prior year. In total, lower realized selling prices decreased 2019 financial results by approximately $380 million after income taxes, compared with 2018. Our average selling prices were as follows: 2019 (a) 2018 (a) 2017 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Including Hedging) United States Onshore $ 53.19 $ 56.90 $ 46.04 Offshore 59.18 62.02 47.34 Total United States 55.15 58.69 46.50 Europe 66.29 70.08 55.03 Africa 64.91 69.64 53.17 Asia 61.81 70.42 56.99 Worldwide 56.77 60.77 49.23 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Excluding Hedging) United States Onshore $ 53.18 $ 60.64 $ 46.76 Offshore 59.17 65.73 48.15 Total United States 55.14 62.41 47.25 Europe 66.29 70.08 55.14 Africa 64.91 69.64 53.25 Asia 61.81 70.42 56.99 Worldwide 56.76 63.80 49.75 Natural Gas Liquids - Per Barrel United States Onshore $ 13.20 $ 21.29 $ 17.67 Offshore 13.31 25.58 21.34 Total United States 13.21 21.81 18.10 Europe — — 29.04 Worldwide 13.21 21.81 18.35 Natural Gas - Per Mcf United States Onshore $ 1.59 $ 2.29 $ 1.96 Offshore 2.12 2.68 2.22 Total United States 1.83 2.43 2.03 Europe 3.81 3.61 4.42 Asia and other 5.04 5.07 4.27 Worldwide 3.90 4.18 3.37 (a) Selling prices in the United States are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in Marketing expenses. Excluding these fees Worldwide selling prices for 2019 would be $59.95 per barrel for crude oil (including hedging) (2018: $63.77), $59.94 per barrel for crude oil (excluding hedging) (2018: $66.80), $13.40 per barrel for NGL (2018: $22.00) and $3.97 per mcf for natural gas (2018: $4.25). Crude oil hedging activities were a net gain of $1 million before and after income taxes in 2019, and a loss of $183 million before and after income taxes in 2018. For calendar year 2020, we have WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 130,000 bopd, and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 20,000 bopd. We expect noncash put option premium amortization, which will be reflected in realized selling prices, to reduce our 2020 results by approximately $70 million per quarter. 33 Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (In thousands) Crude Oil - Barrels United States Bakken 93 76 67 Other Onshore (a) 1 1 6 Total Onshore 94 77 73 Offshore 46 41 39 Total United States 140 118 112 Europe (b) 6 6 28 Africa (c) 19 18 35 Asia and other 4 4 2 Worldwide 169 146 177 Natural Gas Liquids - Barrels United States Bakken 41 29 28 Other Onshore (a) 1 5 8 Total Onshore 42 34 36 Offshore 5 5 5 Total United States 47 39 41 Europe (b) — — 1 Worldwide 47 39 42 Natural Gas - Mcf United States Bakken 107 70 62 Other Onshore (a) 3 44 92 Total Onshore 110 114 154 Offshore 91 67 57 Total United States 201 181 211 Europe (b) 7 8 33 Asia and other 364 364 276 Worldwide 572 553 520 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 311 277 306 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production 69 % 67 % 72 % (a) The Corporation sold its Utica assets in August 2018. Production was 9,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 19,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Corporation sold its Permian assets in August 2017. Production was 4,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017. (b) The Corporation sold its Norway assets in December 2017. Production was 24,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017. (c) The Corporation sold its Equatorial Guinea assets in November 2017. Production was 25,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2020, we expect net production, excluding Libya, to average between 330,000 boepd and 335,000 boepd, compared with 2019 net production, excluding Libya, of 290,000 boepd. Net production variances related to 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows: United States: Bakken net oil production was higher in 2019, primarily due to increased drilling activity and new plug and perf completion design. Bakken net natural gas and NGL production was higher in 2019 also due to the increased drilling activity, additional natural gas captured with the start-up of the Little Missouri 4 natural gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2019 and additional NGL received under percentage of proceeds contracts resulting from lower NGL commodity pricing. The decline in U.S. other onshore net production from 2018 reflects the sale of our interests in the Utica shale play in August 2018. U.S. offshore net production increased in 2019, primarily due to higher production from the Conger and Penn State fields and a new well brought online at the Llano Field. International: In Europe, Africa and Asia, net production was comparable in 2019 with 2018. 34 Sales Volumes: The impact of higher sales volumes from our net production improved after-tax results by approximately $560 million in 2019, compared with 2018. Net worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, which excludes sales volumes of crude oil, NGL and natural gas purchased from third parties, were as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (In thousands) Crude oil – barrels 61,061 52,742 63,367 Natural gas liquids – barrels 17,067 14,019 15,152 Natural gas – mcf 208,665 202,041 190,089 Barrels of Oil Equivalent 112,906 100,435 110,201 Crude oil - barrels per day 167 144 173 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day 47 39 42 Natural gas - mcf per day 572 553 520 Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day 309 275 302 Marketing, including purchased oil and gas (Marketing expense): Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, primarily in the U.S., and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. marketing activities. Marketing expense for 2019 is comparable to 2018 primarily due to lower benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes being largely offset by higher purchases of third-party volumes. Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses, decreased $11 million in 2019, compared to 2018. Cash operating costs in 2018 included pre-tax charges totaling $91 million for vacated office space and severance costs, which more than offset increased costs from higher production in 2019. On a per-unit basis, cash operating costs improved from 2018 reflecting higher net production volumes in 2019. See Exit Costs and Other in Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods on page 37. Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense increased from 2018, primarily due to higher throughput volumes in 2019. In 2020, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $940 million to $965 million. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A): DD&A costs increased by $229 million from 2018 primarily due to higher net production volumes in the Bakken and Gulf of Mexico. Unit costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: Actual Forecast range (a) 2019 2018 2017 2020 Cash operating costs (b) $ 11.99 $ 12.66 $ 14.27 $11.50 — $12.50 DD&A (c) 17.43 17.14 24.53 16.50 — 17.50 Total Production Unit Costs $ 29.42 $ 29.80 $ 38.80 $28.00 — $30.00 (a) Forecast information excludes any contribution from Libya. (b) Cash operating costs per boe, excluding Libya, was $12.54 in 2019 (2018: $13.32). (c) DD&A per boe, excluding Libya, was $18.52 in 2019 (2018: $18.29). Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Exploratory dry hole costs $ 49 $ 165 $ 268 Exploration lease and other impairment 17 37 44 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead 167 160 195 $ 233 $ 362 $ 507 In 2019, dry hole costs primarily related to the Jill-1 well on License 6/16 in Denmark and the Oldfield-1 well in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2018, dry hole costs primarily related to the Aspy well, offshore Nova Scotia, Canada; the Pontoenoe-1 well, offshore Suriname and the Sorubim-1 well on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In 2020, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. 35 Income Taxes: In 2019, income tax expense was $375 million (2018: $391 million), primarily related to our operations in Libya. Commencing in 2017, we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia and Guyana (until December 2019), while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. At December 31, 2019 the valuation allowance established against the net deferred tax asset in Guyana for the Stabroek Block was released as a result of the positive evidence from first production in December 2019, and the significant forecasted pre-tax income from operations. The cumulative pre-tax losses in Guyana were driven by pre-production activities. See E&P items affecting comparability of earnings below. Actual effective tax rates are as follows: 2019 2018 2017 % % % Effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (88) (88) 34 Adjusted effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (a) (36) 60 7 (a) Excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings. In 2020, we estimate income tax expense, excluding Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Gains (losses) on asset sales, net $ 22 $ 24 $ (41 ) $ 22 $ 24 $ (57 ) Cost recovery settlement (21 ) — — (19 ) — — Exit costs and other — (110 ) — — (110 ) — Impairment — — (4,203 ) — — (2,250 ) Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses — — (280 ) — — (280 ) Noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars — — (22 ) — — (22 ) Reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowance — — — 60 — — $ 1 $ (86 ) $ (4,546 ) $ 63 $ (86 ) $ (2,609 ) The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income are as follows: Before Income Taxes 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Sales and other operating revenues $ — $ — $ (22 ) Gains (losses) on asset sales, net 22 24 (41 ) Marketing, including purchased oil and gas (21 ) — — Operating costs and expenses — (19 ) — Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment — (3 ) (280 ) General and administrative expenses — (72 ) — Depreciation, depletion and amortization — (16 ) — Impairment — — (4,203 ) $ 1 $ (86 ) $ (4,546 ) 2019: • Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our remaining acreage in the Utica shale play. • Cost recovery settlement: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $21 million ($19 million after income taxes) related to a settlement on historical cost recovery balances in the JDA that was paid in cash. • Reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowance: We recorded a noncash income tax benefit of $60 million, which resulted from the reversal of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in Guyana upon achieving first production from the Liza Phase 1 development. 36 2018: • Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($14 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio and a pre-tax gain of $10 million ($10 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in Ghana. • Exit costs and other: We incurred noncash pre-tax charges of $73 million ($73 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax severance charge of $37 million ($37 million after income taxes), related to a cost reduction program undertaken to reflect the reduced scale of our business following significant asset sales in 2017. 2017: • Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $486 million ($486 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our assets in Equatorial Guinea, and a pre-tax gain of $330 million ($314 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin. We also incurred a pre-tax loss of $857 million ($857 million after income taxes) on the sale of our interests in Norway. The loss included the recognition of $900 million in earnings for cumulative translation adjustments previously reflected within accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 3, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Impairment: We recorded a noncash impairment charge related to our interests in Norway totaling $2,503 million pre-tax ($550 million after income taxes) in the third quarter prior to the sale of our interests in the fourth quarter. In addition, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the Stampede Field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the Tubular Bells Field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily because of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The Stampede Field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the Pony discovery prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. See Note 13, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $280 million ($280 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of our interest at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license, offshore Ghana (Hess 50% license interest) as a result of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2017 to not develop the previously discovered fields. These costs were incurred in periods prior to 2017. • Noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) related to certain crude oil collars not designated as cash flow hedges. The de-designation was a result of production downtime caused by a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter. 37 Midstream Following is a summarized statement of income for our Midstream operations: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues $ 848 $ 713 $ 617 Losses on asset sales, net — — (51 ) Other, net 4 6 — Total revenues and non-operating income 852 719 566 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses 279 193 195 General and administrative expenses 56 14 16 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 142 127 123 Interest expense 63 60 26 Total costs and expenses 540 394 360 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes 312 325 206 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (a) — 38 31 Net income (loss) 312 287 175 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 168 167 133 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation $ 144 $ 120 $ 42 (a) Commencing January 1, 2019, management changed its measurement of segment earnings to reflect income taxes on a post U.S. tax consolidation and valuation allowance assessment basis. See footnote (a) in the table on page 86 for further details. Sales and other operating revenues increased from 2018 primarily due to higher throughput volumes, increased rail transportation and water trucking revenues associated with third-party services, and higher tariff rates. Operating costs and expenses increased from 2018, primarily due to higher maintenance activity, and increased third party rail transportation and water trucking charges. General and administrative expenses increased in 2019, compared to 2018, as a result of expenditures incurred from Hess Midstream Partners LP’s acquisition of HIP and its corporate restructuring. See Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below. DD&A expenses increased from 2018 primarily due to additional assets places in service, including those related to the Summit acquisition. The increase in interest expense from 2018 reflects higher borrowings by the Midstream business. In 2020, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: In 2019, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($16 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interests) for transaction related costs for Hess Midstream Partners LP’s acquisition of HIP and associated corporate restructuring. See Note 6, Hess Midstream in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2017, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $57 million ($34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interests) related to the sale of our Midstream assets in the Permian Basin. 38 Corporate, Interest and Other The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 114 $ 97 $ 160 Interest expense 355 359 385 Less: Capitalized interest (38 ) (20 ) (86 ) Interest expense, net 317 339 299 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes 431 436 459 Provision (benefit) for income taxes — (3 ) (26 ) Net Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes 431 433 433 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after income taxes 174 20 30 Total Corporate, Interest and Other Expenses After Income Taxes $ 605 $ 453 $ 463 Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, increased from 2018 primarily due to lower interest income and a reduction in other non-operating income. In 2020, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million. Interest expense for 2019 is comparable to 2018. Capitalized interest increased from 2018 due to ongoing development activity in Guyana, including the sanction of the Liza Field Phase 2 development during 2019. In 2020, after-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million. The estimated increase in 2020 is due to ceasing interest capitalization at the Liza Field, which commenced production in December 2019. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: 2019: • Pension settlement: We recorded a noncash pension settlement charge of $88 million ($88 million after income taxes) associated with the purchase of a single premium annuity contract by the Hess Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan to settle and transfer certain of its obligations to a third party. The charge is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. See Note 10, Retirement Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Income tax: We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax expense of $86 million that was previously a component of accumulated other comprehensive income related to our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts. 2018: • Loss on debt extinguishment: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $53 million ($53 million after income taxes) related to the premium paid for debt repurchases. See Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. • Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $58 million ($58 million after income taxes) resulting from the settlement of legal claims related to former downstream interests. • Income tax: We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax benefit of $91 million to offset the recognition of a noncash income tax expense recorded in other comprehensive income resulting primarily from changes in fair value of our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts. 2017: • Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($30 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space, of which $11 million is included in General and administrative expenses and $19 million is included in Depreciation, depletion and amortization in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 39 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2019 2018 (In millions, except ratio) Cash and cash equivalents (a) $ 1,545 $ 2,694 Current maturities of long-term debt — 67 Total debt (b) 7,142 6,672 Total equity 9,706 10,888 Debt to capitalization ratio (c) 43.2 % 38.0 % (a) Includes $3 million of cash attributable to our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2019 (2018: $109 million). (b) Includes $1,753 million of debt outstanding from our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2019 (2018: $981 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. (c) Total debt (including finance lease obligations) as a percentage of the sum of total debt (including finance lease obligations) plus equity. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases, finance lease obligations were included in debt. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,642 $ 1,939 $ 945 Investing activities (2,843 ) (1,566 ) 1,358 Financing activities 52 (2,526 ) (188 ) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (1,149 ) $ (2,153 ) $ 2,115 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,642 million in 2019 (2018: $1,939 million), while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2,237 million in 2019 (2018: $2,129 million). Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased from 2018 primarily due to higher net production volumes, partially offset by lower commodity prices. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by $595 million (2018: $190 million reduction), primarily from premiums paid on crude oil hedge contracts, abandonment expenditures, pension contributions and an increase in accounts receivable. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2018 primarily related to premiums on crude oil hedge contracts and abandonment expenditures. Investing Activities: Total Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment were $2,829 million in 2019 (2018: $2,097 million). The increase in Additions to property, plant and equipment from 2018 is primarily related to increased drilling activity in the Bakken, increased exploration and development activity on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, and the Midstream operating segment’s acquisition of assets from Summit Midstream Partners LP. In 2019, Midstream equity investments in its 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources were $33 million (2018: $67 million). Proceeds from asset sales were $22 million in 2019 (2018: $607 million; 2017: $3,296 million). See Note 3, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing Activities: Repayments of debt were $8 million in 2019 (2018: $633 million) while borrowings with maturities in excess of 90 days of $760 million in 2019 related to our Midstream operating segment. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $316 million in 2019 (2018: $345 million). We settled $25 million of common stock purchases in 2019 (2018: $1,365 million). Net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were $353 million in 2019 (2018: $211 million). Future Capital Requirements and Resources At December 31, 2019, Hess Corporation, had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $5.4 billion. The Corporation has no significant near-term debt maturities. Currently, we have WTI put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 130,000 bopd, and Brent put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 20,000 bopd. Net production in 2020 is forecast to be in the range of 330,000 boepd to 335,000 boepd, excluding Libya, and we expect our 2020 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $3.0 billion. In 2020, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2019, and our available committed revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends. 40 The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2019: Letters of Expiration Credit Total Available Date Capacity Borrowings Issued Used Capacity (In millions) Hess Corporation Revolving credit facility May 2023 $ 3,500 $ — $ — $ — $ 3,500 Committed lines Various (a) 445 — 54 54 391 Uncommitted lines Various (a) 218 — 218 218 — Total - Hess Corporation $ 4,163 $ — $ 272 $ 272 $ 3,891 Midstream Revolving credit facility (b) December 2024 $ 1,000 $ 32 $ — $ 32 $ 968 Total - Midstream $ 1,000 $ 32 $ — $ 32 $ 968 (a) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates throughout 2020. (b) This credit facility may only be utilized by HESM Opco and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. Hess Corporation: In 2019, the Corporation entered into a new $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 15, 2023, which replaced the Corporation’s previous revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on January 21, 2021. The new facility, which is fully undrawn, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the new facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above LIBOR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The facility is subject to customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization (as such terms are defined in the credit agreement for the facility) of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and customary events of default. At December 31, 2019, the Corporation was in compliance with its financial covenants. We had $272 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2019 (2018: $284 million), which primarily relate to our international operations. See also Note 19, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Midstream: At December 31, 2019, Hess Midstream Operations LP (formerly Hess Midstream Partners LP, or HESM Opco), a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, had $1.4 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing December 16, 2024, consisting of a $1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn $400 million 5-year Term Loan A facility. The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund HESM Opco’s operating activities, capital expenditures, distributions and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. HESM Opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2019. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all the presently owned and after-acquired assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2019, borrowings of $32 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s Term Loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 41 Credit Ratings Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt have assigned an investment grade rating. At December 31, 2019, we have investment grade credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings (BBB-). Moody’s Investors Service has rated our debt at Ba1. The consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities, and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements, which are not material at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, HESM Opco’s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, and Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2019: Payments Due by Period 2021 and 2023 and Total 2020 2022 2024 Thereafter (In millions) Total Debt (excludes interest) (a) $ 7,220 $ — $ 30 $ 702 $ 6,488 Finance Leases (b) 392 36 72 72 212 Operating Leases (b) 599 200 137 129 133 Purchase Obligations: Capital expenditures (b) 1,743 913 755 75 — Operating expenses (b) 190 158 20 9 3 Transportation and related contracts (b) 1,009 231 424 246 108 Asset retirement obligations 2,172 127 202 45 1,798 Other liabilities 565 114 113 100 238 (a) We anticipate cash payments for interest on Total Debt of $422 million for 2020, $831 million for 2021-2022, $817 million for 2023-2024, and $3,640 million thereafter for a total of $5,710 million. These interest payments reflect our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019. (b) Comprises obligations, including where we, as operator, have contracted directly with suppliers. Capital expenditures represent amounts that we were contractually committed at December 31, 2019, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2020. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries primarily lease drilling rigs, equipment, logistical assets (offshore vessels, aircraft, and shorebases), and office space for varying periods. See Note 7, Leases in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2019, we had $272 million in letters of credit. See also Note 17, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations We conduct E&P activities outside the U.S., principally in Guyana, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand and Malaysia, Denmark, Libya, Suriname, and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, currency risk, corruption, and acts of terrorism. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details. 42 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E&P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year. Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2020 are at levels below that used in determining 2019 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2020 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2020 above those used in determining 2019 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2020. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2020, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2020 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2020 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019 would result in an approximate $200 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2020 based on projected production volumes. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 90 through 98 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves. Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, 43 prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. Our impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. While crude oil prices in 2019 were lower than last year, we could experience an asset impairment in the future if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. Midstream Joint Venture: We consolidate the activities of our interest in Hess Midstream LP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered Hess Midstream LP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between Hess Midstream LP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of Hess Midstream LP. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. Due to a sustained low commodity price environment, we remained in a three-year cumulative consolidated loss position at December 31, 2019. A three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only) and Malaysia while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. In December 2019, we reversed the valuation allowance of $60 million for Guyana upon achieving first production from the Liza Phase 1 development. At December 31, 2019, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $4,734 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth. Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E&P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are 44 required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations. Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. The most significant assumptions relate to: Discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations: The discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligations is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. At December 31, 2019, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately $120 million and forecasted 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately $10 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligations would decrease the funded status of our pension plans, but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios. Expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets: The expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. At December 31, 2019, a 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately $5 million. Other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality level. Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs 45 may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value assigned for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Environment, Health and Safety Our long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. We are committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions regulations and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include E&P facilities, sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2019, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $70 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $20 million in 2019 (2018: $15 million; 2017: $15 million). The amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 46 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options in our risk management activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them: • Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. • Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound and Danish Krone, which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of those currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. • Exchange-traded Contracts: We may use exchange-traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. • Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange-traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and have the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. Financial Risk Management Activities At December 31, 2019, outstanding total debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments, had a carrying value of $7,142 million and a fair value of $8,242 million. A 15% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $450 million or $490 million, respectively. Any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixed rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity. We have WTI put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 130,000 bopd, and Brent put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 20,000 bopd. As of December 31, 2019, an assumed 10% increase in the forward WTI and Brent crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our put options would reduce the fair value of these derivatives instruments by approximately $60 million, while an assumed 10% decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $110 million. We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with a total notional amount of $90 million at December 31, 2019 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $5 million at December 31, 2019. See Note 19, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 47 Item 8.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, as stated in their report, which is included herein. By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. Rielly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John B. Hess Chief Executive Officer February 20, 2020 49 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York February 20, 2020 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hess Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and natural gas properties 51 Description of the Matter The net book value of the Corporation’s exploration and production assets was $13,792 million at December 31, 2019, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $1,977 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Corporation follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, DD&A expense is recorded using the units-of-production method, based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by petroleum engineering specialists, for property acquisition costs and proved developed oil and gas reserves, also estimated by petroleum engineering specialists, for oil and gas production facilities and wells. Proved oil and gas reserves are based on geological and engineering evaluations of estimated in-place hydrocarbon volumes using financial and non-financial inputs. Significant judgment is required by the Corporations’ internal engineering staff in evaluating the geological and engineering data used to estimate reserves. Estimating proved reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and natural gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. Management used independent petroleum engineering specialists to audit approximately 80 percent of the Corporation’s proved reserves at December 31, 2019 as prepared by the Corporation’s internal engineering staff. Auditing the Corporation’s DD&A expense calculation is complex because of our need to assess the reasonableness of management’s determination of the inputs described above used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves and to use the work of the internal engineering staff and independent petroleum engineering specialists. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the DD&A expense calculation. This included controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves. Our testing of the Corporation’s DD&A expense calculation included, among other procedures, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Corporation’s internal petroleum engineering specialist responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s reserve estimates and of the independent petroleum engineering specialist used to audit the estimates. In addition, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing significant inputs to source documentation, where available, on a sample basis and assessing the inputs for reasonableness based on review of corroborative evidence and consideration of any contrary evidence. For proved undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management’s development plans for compliance with the SEC rule that undrilled locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time, by assessing consistency of the development projection with the Corporation’s drill plan and the availability of capital relative to the drill plan. Additionally, we performed analytic and lookback procedures on inputs into the oil and gas reserve estimate as well as on the outputs. Finally, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the DD&A expense calculations, including comparing the proved oil and gas reserves to the Corporation’s reserve report. Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets Description of the Matter At December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $1,028 million of total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, related to deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Corporation records a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of all available evidence, in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets totaled $4,734 million as of December 31, 2019. Auditing management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets was subjective because management’s estimate was judgmental and involved assessing the weight of positive and negative evidence, often based on significant assumptions that may be affected by future market or economic conditions. This included, among other things, evaluation of the history of operating income or losses, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and forecasts of future taxable income (exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards). 52 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Corporation’s controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including, where applicable, controls over projections of future taxable income. We also tested management’s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the estimates. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating management’s weighting of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance was required as well as testing the material assumptions used by the Corporation to develop estimates of future taxable income, where applicable, by jurisdiction. We tested the underlying data used in the Corporation’s projections, by comparing key inputs used to develop future taxable income with historical information as well as evaluating management’s consideration of current industry conditions and economic trends incorporated in such projections. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Corporation’s auditor since 1971 New York, New York February 20, 2020 53 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET December 31, 2019 2018 (In millions, except share amounts) Assets Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,545 $ 2,694 Accounts receivable: From contracts with customers 940 771 Joint venture and other 230 230 Inventories 261 245 Other current assets 180 519 Total current assets 3,156 4,459 Property, plant and equipment: Total — at cost 35,820 33,222 Less: Reserves for depreciation, depletion, amortization and lease impairment 19,006 17,139 Property, plant and equipment — net 16,814 16,083 Operating lease right-of-use assets — net 447 — Finance lease right-of-use assets — net 299 — Goodwill 360 360 Deferred income taxes 80 21 Other assets 626 510 Total Assets $ 21,782 $ 21,433 Liabilities Current Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 411 $ 495 Accrued liabilities 1,803 1,560 Taxes payable 97 81 Current maturities of long-term debt — 67 Current portion of operating and finance lease obligations 199 — Total current liabilities 2,510 2,203 Long-term debt 7,142 6,605 Long-term operating lease obligations 353 — Long-term finance lease obligations 238 — Deferred income taxes 415 421 Asset retirement obligations 897 741 Other liabilities and deferred credits 521 575 Total Liabilities 12,076 10,545 Equity Hess Corporation stockholders’ equity: Preferred stock, par value $1.00; Authorized — 20,000,000 shares: Series A 8% Cumulative Mandatory Convertible; $1,000 per share liquidation preference; Issued — zero shares (2018: 574,997) — 1 Common stock, par value $1.00; Authorized — 600,000,000 shares: Issued — 304,955,472 shares (2018: 291,434,534) 305 291 Capital in excess of par value 5,591 5,386 Retained earnings 3,535 4,257 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (699 ) (306 ) Total Hess Corporation stockholders’ equity 8,732 9,629 Noncontrolling interests 974 1,259 Total equity 9,706 10,888 Total Liabilities and Equity $ 21,782 $ 21,433 The consolidated financial statements reflect the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.

Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “Hess”, “the Corporation”, “Registrant”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the consolidated business operations of Hess Corporation and its affiliates. Nature of Business: Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas with production operations and development activities located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), Malaysia and Denmark. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2019 (see Note 6, Hess Midstream) provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess Corporation and entities in which we own more than a 50% voting interest. Commencing December 16, 2019, we consolidate Hess Midstream LP, a variable interest entity that acquired Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), based on our conclusion that we have the power through Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. Prior to December 16, 2019, we consolidated HIP, also a variable interest entity based on the conclusion we had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of HIP. Our undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas E&P ventures are proportionately consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned and where we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method. On January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases. ASC 842 supersedes ASC 840 and requires the recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for all leases with lease terms greater than one year, including leases previously treated as operating leases under ASC 840. We adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective method which allows the standard to be applied prospectively. No cumulative effect adjustment was recorded to Retained Earnings at January 1, 2019, and comparative financial statements for periods prior to adoption of ASC 842 were not affected. We elected to apply a number of practical expedients permitted by the standard, including not needing to reassess: (i) whether existing contracts are (or contain) leases, (ii) whether the lease classification for existing leases would differ under ASC 842, (iii) whether initial direct costs incurred for existing leases are capitalizable under ASC 842, and (iv) land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under ASC 840. We also elected to not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset for short-term leases as defined in ASC 842. This standard does not apply to leases acquired for oil and gas producing activities that are accounted for under ASC 932, Extractive Activities – Oil and Gas. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have an impact on our Statement of Consolidated Income or Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. The impact of adoption on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1, 2019, was as follows: December 31, 2018 Adjustment for Finance Leases Adjustment for Operating Leases January 1, 2019 (In millions) Assets Property, plant and equipment — net $ 16,083 $ (346 ) $ — $ 15,737 Operating lease right-of-use assets — net — — 804 804 Finance lease right-of-use assets — net — 346 — 346 Liabilities Accrued liabilities 1,560 — (2 ) 1,558 Current maturities of long-term debt 67 (55 ) — 12 Current portion of operating and finance lease obligations — 55 382 437 Long-term debt 6,605 (254 ) — 6,351 Long-term operating lease obligations — — 516 516 Long-term finance lease obligations — 254 — 254 Other liabilities and deferred credits 575 — (92 ) 483 In 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU makes certain targeted improvements to the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740, including removal of the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod 59 tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or gain from other items, such as other comprehensive income. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2021, with early adoption permitted. We elected to adopt this ASU effective October 1, 2019, and the adoption had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates and Assumptions: In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in our Statement of Consolidated Income. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves, asset and other valuations, depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes. Revenue Recognition: Exploration and Production The E&P segment recognizes revenue from the sale of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as performance obligations under contracts with customers are satisfied. Our responsibilities to deliver each unit of quantity of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas under these contracts represent separate, distinct performance obligations. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer. Generally, the control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer upon the transfer of legal title at the point of physical delivery. Pricing is variable and is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials. For long-term international natural gas contracts with ship-or-pay provisions, our obligation to stand-ready to provide a minimum volume over each commitment period represents separate, distinct performance obligations. Penalties owed against future deliveries of natural gas due to delivery of volumes below minimum delivery commitments are recognized as reductions to revenue in the commitment period when the shortfall occurs. Long-term international natural gas contracts may also contain take-or-pay provisions whereby the customer is required to pay for volumes not taken that are below the minimum volume commitment, but the customer has certain make-up rights to receive shortfall volumes in subsequent periods. Shortfall payments received from customers when volumes purchased are below the minimum volume commitment are deferred upon receipt as a contract liability. Revenue is recognized at the earlier of when we deliver the make-up volumes in subsequent periods or when it becomes remote that the customer will exercise their make-up rights. Certain crude oil, NGL, and natural gas volumes are purchased by Hess from third parties, including working interest partners and royalty owners in certain Hess-operated properties, before they are sold to customers. Where control over the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas transfers to Hess before the volumes are transferred to the customer, revenue and the associated cost of purchased volumes are presented on a gross basis in the Statement of Consolidated Income within Sales and other operating revenues and Marketing, including purchased oil and gas, respectively. Where control of crude oil, NGL, or natural gas is not transferred to Hess, revenue is presented net of the associated cost of purchased volumes within Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Contract types: The following is a summary of contract types for our E&P segment: Crude oil, NGL, and natural gas – United States (U.S.): Contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. crude oil, NGL, and natural gas primarily include those contracts that involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period, and those contracts that automatically renew on a periodic basis until either party cancels. We have certain long-term contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. natural gas and NGL that have remaining durations ranging from one to twelve years. Contracts may specify a fixed volume for delivery subject to tolerance thresholds or may specify a percentage of production to be delivered from a particular location. Pricing is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials. Crude oil – International: Contracts with customers for the sale of international crude oil involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period. These contracts specify a fixed volume for delivery subject to tolerance thresholds. Pricing is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials, shortly after control of the volumes transfers to the customer. Natural gas – International: Contracts with customers for the sale of natural gas are in the form of natural gas sales agreements with government entities that have durations that are aligned with the durations of production sharing contracts or other contractual arrangements with host governments. Pricing is determined using contractual formulas that are based on the price of alternative fuels as obtained from price indices and other factors. These contracts also specify a minimum volume we are obligated to make available during specified periods within the contract term and may specify minimum volumes the customer is obligated to purchase during specified periods within the contract 60 term. If we do not deliver the volume properly nominated by the customer, the customer is entitled to a price discount on future volumes equivalent to the shortfall delivery. Under certain international natural gas sales agreements, if the customer purchases natural gas volumes below the minimum volume commitment, the customer is required to pay us for the shortfall volumes and may receive make-up volumes in subsequent periods at no additional cost. Revenue from sale of third-party purchased volumes: Crude oil, NGL, and natural gas are purchased by Hess from third parties, including working interest partners and royalty owners in certain Hess-operated properties, before they are sold to customers. The types of contracts with customers for the sale of third-party purchased volumes are the same as those described above. Contract Balances: Our right to receive or collect payment from the customer is aligned with the timing of revenue recognition except in situations when we receive shortfall payments under contracts with take-or-pay provisions with customer make-up rights. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no contract assets or contract liabilities. Generally, we receive payments from customers on a monthly basis, shortly after the physical delivery of the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas. We did not recognize any credit losses on receivables with customers during 2019 nor 2018. Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations: The transaction price allocated to our wholly unsatisfied performance obligations on uncompleted contracts is variable. Further, many of our contracts with customers have durations of less than twelve months. Accordingly, we have elected under the provisions of ASC 606 the exemption from disclosure of revenue recognizable in future periods as these performance obligations are satisfied. Sales-based Taxes: We exclude sales-based taxes that are collected from customers from the transaction price in our contracts with customers. Accordingly, revenue from contracts with customers is net of sales-based taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Midstream Our Midstream segment provides gathering, compression, processing, fractionation, storage, terminaling, loading and transportation, and water handling services. The Midstream segment has multiple long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with a marketing subsidiary of Hess, each generally with an initial ten-year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of our Midstream segment. These contracts have minimum volumes the customer is obligated to provide each calendar quarter. The minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation based on nominations covering substantially all of our E&P segment’s production and projected third-party volumes that will be purchased in the Bakken. As the minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation, and as these contracts contain fee inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, substantially all of the transaction price at contract inception is variable. The Midstream segment also provides water handling services to a subsidiary of Hess for an agreed-upon fee per barrel or the reimbursement of third-party fees. The Midstream segment’s responsibilities to provide each of the above services for each year under each of the commercial agreements are considered separate, distinct performance obligations. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation under these commercial agreements over-time as services are rendered using the output method, measured using the amount of volumes serviced during the period. The Midstream segment has elected the practical expedient under the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers to recognize revenue in the amount it is entitled to invoice. If the commercial agreements have ship-or-pay provisions, the Midstream segment’s responsibility to stand-ready to service a minimum volume over each quarterly commitment period represent separate, distinct performance obligations. Shortfall payments received under ship-or-pay provisions are recognized as revenue in the calendar quarter the shortfall occurs as the customer does not have make-up rights beyond the calendar quarter end of the quarterly commitment period. All revenues, receivables, and contract balances arising from the commercial agreements between the Midstream segment and the Hess marketing subsidiary that is the counterparty to the commercial agreements are eliminated upon consolidation. Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a 61 sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: We record depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production facilities and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. Capitalized Interest: Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets. Impairment of Long‑lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a projected amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows reported in Supplementary Oil and Gas Data, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. To determine whether an indicator of impairment exists, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over fair value, limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2019, goodwill of $360 million relates to the Midstream operating segment. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily comprises cash on hand and on deposit, as well as highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired. Inventories: Unsold crude oil and NGL are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined based on the average cost of production. Materials and supplies are valued at cost. Obsolete or surplus materials identified during periodic reviews are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. We assign cumulative historical losses significant weight in the evaluation of realizability relative to more subjective evidence such as forecasts of future income. In 62 addition, we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We are no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to the book in excess of tax basis in the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Because of U.S. tax reform we expect that the future reversal of such temporary differences will occur free of material taxation. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. We account for the U.S. tax effect of global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries in the period that such income is earned. We utilize the aggregate approach for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or the seabed at certain E&P locations. We initially recognize a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred and capitalize the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long‑lived assets. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Fair value is determined by applying a credit adjusted risk-free rate to the undiscounted expected future abandonment expenditures, which represent Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Retirement Plans: We recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. We recognize the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the remaining average expected life if a plan’s participants are predominantly inactive. Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments for financial risk management activities. In these activities, we may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by GAAP. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying nonmonetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long‑lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value assigned for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. 63 Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange-traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded contracts. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Netting of Financial Instruments: We generally enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate legal and counterparty credit risk. Master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty, commonly known as the “safe harbor” provisions. If a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterparty’s bankruptcy, these rights are generally enforceable with respect to “safe harbor” transactions. If these arrangements provide the right of offset and our intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination, our policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis. In the normal course of business, we rely on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses providing for adequate credit assurance as well as close‑out netting, including two‑party netting and single counterparty multilateral netting. As applied to us, “two‑party netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single Hess entity, and “single counterparty multilateral netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple Hess entities. We are reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Share-based Compensation: We account for share-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting. The fair value of all share‑based compensation is recognized over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting, net of actual forfeitures. We estimate fair value at the date of grant using a Black‑Scholes valuation model for employee stock options and a Monte Carlo simulation model for performance share units (PSUs). Fair value of restricted stock is based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. Foreign Currency Translation: The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in which business is conducted) for our foreign operations. Adjustments resulting from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. For our former operations in Norway that did not use the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency, adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. Dollars were recorded in a separate component of equity titled Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) prior to the disposition. See Note 3, Dispositions. Maintenance and Repairs: Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capital improvements are recorded as additions in Property, plant and equipment. Environmental Expenditures: We accrue and expense the undiscounted environmental costs necessary to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year‑end 2019, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $70 million. Environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment are capitalized. New Accounting Pronouncements: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. This ASU makes changes to the impairment model for trade receivables, net investments in leases, debt securities, loans and certain other instruments. The standard requires the use of a forward-looking ""expected loss"" model compared with the current ""incurred loss"" model. We will adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2020 when the standard becomes effective and it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 64 2.

Dispositions 2019: We completed the sale of our remaining acreage in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio for proceeds of $22 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes). 2018: We completed the sale of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio in August for proceeds of $396 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($14 million after income taxes). In addition, we completed the sale of our interests in Ghana for total consideration of $100 million, consisting of a $25 million payment that was received at closing and a further payment of $75 million that is payable to us upon the buyer receiving government approval for a Plan of Development on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block. The receipt of proceeds at closing resulted in a pre-tax gain of $10 million ($10 million after income taxes). 2017: We completed the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin in August for proceeds of $597 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $273 million ($280 million attributable to Hess Corporation after income taxes and noncontrolling interests). This sale transaction included both upstream and midstream assets resulting in an after-tax gain of $314 million allocated to the E&P segment, and an after-tax loss of $34 million allocated to the Midstream segment. In November, we completed the sale of our interests in Equatorial Guinea for proceeds of $449 million, after normal closing adjustments, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $486 million ($486 million after income taxes). In December, we completed the sale of our interests in the Valhall and Hod assets, offshore Norway for proceeds of $2,056 million, after normal closing adjustments, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $857 million ($857 million after income taxes). This loss included the recognition of cumulative translation adjustments totaling $900 million in earnings that were previously reflected within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Stockholders’ Equity. We also sold certain U.S. onshore assets for proceeds totaling approximately $194 million and recognized net pre-tax gains totaling $12 million ($12 million after income taxes). 65 Pre-tax income (loss) associated with our interests in Equatorial Guinea and Norway, excluding the financial statement impacts resulting from the asset sales in 2017, were as follows for the three years ended December 31: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Equatorial Guinea (a) $ — $ — $ 69 Norway (b) — — (55 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes $ — $ — $ 14 (a) Pre-tax income for 2017 excludes the gain of $486 million related to sale of our assets in November 2017. (b) Pre-tax loss for 2017 excludes the loss of $857 million related to sale of our assets in December 2017. In addition, the 2017 loss excludes a pre-tax impairment charge of $2,503 million associated with the disposition. 4. Inventories Inventories at December 31 were as follows: 2019 2018 (In millions) Crude oil and natural gas liquids $ 92 $ 74 Materials and supplies 169 171 Total Inventories $ 261 $ 245 5. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment at December 31 were as follows: 2019 2018 (In millions) Exploration and Production Unproved properties $ 168 $ 394 Proved properties 3,304 3,124 Wells, equipment and related facilities 28,404 26,173 31,876 29,691 Midstream 3,904 3,492 Corporate and Other 40 39 Total — at cost 35,820 33,222 Less: Reserves for depreciation, depletion, amortization and lease impairment 19,006 17,139 Property, Plant and Equipment — Net $ 16,814 $ 16,083 Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs: The following table discloses the amount of capitalized exploratory well costs pending determination of proved reserves at December 31, and the changes therein during the respective years: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $ 418 $ 304 $ 597 Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves 224 128 116 Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves (58 ) — (165 ) Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense — (14 ) (268 ) Dispositions and other — — 24 Balance at December 31 $ 584 $ 418 $ 304 Number of Wells at December 31 31 24 12 During the three years ended December 31, 2019, additions to capitalized exploratory well costs primarily related to drilling at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. Other drilling activity included the Esox prospect in the Gulf of Mexico during 2019 and the Bunga prospect in Malaysia during 2018. Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves in 2019 primarily related to the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, where the Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned and the Esox discovery. In 2017, the Liza Phase 1 development was sanctioned. 66 Capitalized exploratory well costs included in the table above that were charged to expense include the following: 2018: In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia (Hess 50% participating interest), the operator, BP Canada, completed drilling of the Aspy exploration well, which did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. As a result, we expensed well costs totaling $120 million of which $106 million was incurred and expensed in 2018. 2017: In Ghana, at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license (Hess 50% license interest), management determined in the fourth quarter of 2017 that we would not develop the previously discovered fields. As a result, we recorded a charge of $268 million to write-off previously capitalized exploration wells. The preceding table excludes well costs incurred and expensed during 2019 of $49 million (2018: $151 million; 2017: $0 million). Exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling were $400 million at December 31, 2019, separated by year of completion as follows (in millions): 2018 $ 157 2017 73 2016 — 2015 166 2014 and prior 4 $ 400 Guyana: Approximately 50% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to ten successful exploration wells where hydrocarbons were encountered on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. The operator plans further appraisal drilling for certain fields and is conducting pre-development planning for additional phases of development beyond the two existing sanctioned phases of development. Gulf of Mexico: Approximately 30% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the appraisal of the northern portion of the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) in the Gulf of Mexico, where hydrocarbons were encountered in the fourth quarter of 2015. Following exploration and appraisal drilling activities completed by the operator in prior years on adjacent blocks to the north of our Shenzi blocks, the operator commenced acquiring 3D seismic in 2019 for use in ongoing appraisal and development planning of the northern portion of the Shenzi Field. JDA: Approximately 10% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess 50%) where hydrocarbons were encountered in three successful exploration wells drilled in the western part of Block A-18. The operator has submitted a development plan concept to the regulator to facilitate ongoing commercial negotiations for an extension of the existing gas sales contract to include development of the western part of the Block. Malaysia: Approximately 10% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia (Hess 50%), where hydrocarbons were encountered in five successful exploration wells. We are continuing with pre-development planning for future phases of field development. 67 6. Hess Midstream Prior to December 16, 2019, the Midstream segment was primarily comprised of HIP, a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), formed to own, operate, develop and acquire a diverse set of midstream assets to provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers. HIP was initially formed on May 21, 2015, with Hess selling 50% of HIP to GIP for approximately $2.6 billion on July 1, 2015. On April 10, 2017, HIP completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 16,997,000 common units, representing 30.5% limited partnership interests in its subsidiary Hess Midstream Partners LP (Hess Midstream Partners), for net proceeds of approximately $365.5 million. In connection with the IPO, HIP contributed a 20% controlling economic interest in each of Hess North Dakota Pipeline Operations LP, Hess TGP Operations LP, and Hess North Dakota Export Logistics Operations LP, and a 100% economic interest in Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC (collectively the “Contributed Businesses”). In exchange for the contributed businesses, Hess and GIP each received common and subordinated units representing a direct 33.75% limited partner interest in Hess Midstream Partners and a 50% indirect ownership interest through HIP in Hess Midstream Partners’ general partner, which had a 2% economic interest in Hess Midstream Partners plus incentive distribution rights. On March 1, 2019, HIP acquired Hess’s existing Bakken water services business for $225 million in cash. As a result of this transaction between entities under common control, we recorded an after-tax gain of $78 million in additional paid-in capital with an offsetting reduction to noncontrolling interest to reflect the adjustment to GIP’s noncontrolling interest in HIP. On March 22, 2019, HIP and Hess Midstream Partners acquired crude oil and gas gathering assets, and HIP acquired water gathering assets of Summit Midstream Partners LP’s Tioga Gathering System for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $90 million, with the potential for an additional $10 million of contingent payments in future periods subject to certain future performance metrics. On January 25, 2018, Hess Midstream Partners entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources Corp. to construct a new 200 million standard cubic feet per day gas processing plant called Little Missouri 4. The plant, which is operated by Targa, was placed into service in the third quarter of 2019. On December 16, 2019, Hess Midstream Partners acquired HIP, including HIP’s 80% interest in Hess Midstream Partners’ oil and gas midstream assets, HIP’s water services business and the outstanding economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in Hess Midstream Partners LP. In addition, Hess Midstream Partners’ organizational structure converted from a master limited partnership into an “Up-C” structure in which Hess Midstream Partners’ public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares in a new public entity named Hess Midstream LP (Hess Midstream), which is taxed as a corporation for U.S. Federal and State income tax purposes. Hess Midstream Partners changed its name to “Hess Midstream Operations LP” (HESM Opco) and became a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream, the new publicly listed entity. As consideration for the acquisition, we received a cash payment of $301 million and approximately 115 million newly issued HESM Opco Class B units. After giving effect to the acquisition and related transactions, public shareholders of Class A shares in Hess Midstream own 6% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis and Hess and GIP each own 47% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis, primarily through the sponsors’ ownership of Class B units in HESM Opco that are exchangeable into Class A shares of Hess Midstream on a one-for-one basis, or referred to as “Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership in Hess Midstream LP”. At December 31, 2019, Hess Midstream liabilities totaling $1,941 million are on a nonrecourse basis to Hess Corporation, while Hess Midstream assets available to settle the obligations of Hess Midstream included Cash and cash equivalents totaling $3 million and Property, plant and equipment, net totaling $3,010 million. At December 31, 2018, HIP liabilities totaling $1,105 million were on a nonrecourse basis to Hess Corporation, while HIP assets available to settle the obligations of HIP included Cash and cash equivalents totaling $109 million and Property, plant and equipment, net totaling $2,664 million. 68 7. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception by evaluating whether the contract conveys the right to control an identified asset during the period of use. ROU assets represent our right to use an identified asset for the lease term and lease obligations represent our obligation to make payments as set forth in the lease arrangement. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as operating leases or finance leases at the commencement date based on the present value of the minimum lease payments over the lease term. Where the implicit discount rate in a lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date for determining the present value of the minimum lease payments. The lease term used in measurement of our lease obligations includes options to extend or terminate the lease when, in our judgment, it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the measurement of lease obligations using the index or rate at the commencement date. Variable lease payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances after the commencement date of the lease are not included in the minimum lease payments used to measure lease obligations. We have agreements that include financial obligations for lease and nonlease components. For purposes of measuring lease obligations, we have elected not to separate nonlease components from lease components for the following classes of assets: drilling rigs, office space, offshore vessels, and aircraft. We apply a portfolio approach to account for operating lease ROU assets and liabilities for certain vehicles, railcars, field equipment and office equipment leases. Finance lease cost is recognized as amortization of the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. Operating lease cost is generally recognized on a straight-line basis. Operating lease costs for drilling rigs used to drill development wells and successful exploration wells are capitalized. Operating lease cost for other ROU assets used in oil and gas producing activities are either capitalized or expensed on a straight-line basis based on the nature of operation for which the ROU asset is utilized. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as permitted under ASC 842. We recognize lease cost for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Some of our leases include one or more options to renew. The renewal option is at our sole discretion and is not included in the lease term for measurement of the lease obligation unless we are reasonably certain, at the commencement date of the lease, to renew the lease. Operating and finance leases presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 were as follows: Operating Leases Finance Leases (In millions) Right-of-use assets — net (a) $ 447 $ 299 Lease obligations: Current $ 182 $ 17 Long-term 353 238 Total lease obligations $ 535 $ 255 (a) Finance lease ROU assets have a cost of $381 million and accumulated amortization of $82 million. Lease obligations represent 100% of the present value of future minimum lease payments in the lease arrangement. Where we have contracted directly with a lessor in our role as operator of an unincorporated oil and gas venture, we bill our partners their proportionate share for reimbursements as payments under lease agreements become due pursuant to the terms of our joint operating and other agreements. The nature of our leasing arrangements at December 31, 2019 was as follows: Operating leases: In the normal course of business, we primarily lease drilling rigs, equipment, logistical assets (offshore vessels, aircraft, and shorebases), and office space. Finance leases: In 2018, as detailed in Note 8, Debt, we entered into a sale and lease-back arrangement for a floating storage and offloading vessel (FSO) to handle produced condensate at North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia (Hess operated – 50%). The remaining lease term utilized in the lease obligation is 13.8 years. 69 Maturities of lease obligations at December 31, 2019 were as follows: Operating Leases Finance Leases (In millions) 2020 $ 200 $ 36 2021 72 36 2022 65 36 2023 64 36 2024 65 36 Remaining years 133 212 Total lease payments 599 392 Less: Imputed interest (64 ) (137 ) Total lease obligations $ 535 $ 255 The following information relates to the Operating and Finance leases recorded at December 31, 2019: Operating Leases Finance Leases Weighted average remaining lease term 5.4 years 13.8 years Range of remaining lease terms 0.1 - 16.1 years 13.8 years Weighted average discount rate 4.3% 7.9% The components of lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Operating lease cost $ 414 Finance lease cost: Amortization of leased assets 43 Interest on lease obligations 21 Short-term lease cost (a) 164 Variable lease cost (b) 89 Sublease income (c) (12 ) Total lease cost (d) $ 719 (a) Short-term lease cost is primarily attributable to equipment used in global exploration, development, and production activities. Future short-term lease costs will vary based on activity levels of our operated assets. (b) Variable lease costs for the drilling rig leases result from differences in the minimum rate and the actual usage of the ROU asset during the lease period. Variable lease costs for logistical assets result from differences in stated monthly rates and total charges reflecting the actual usage of the ROU asset during the lease period. Variable lease costs for our office leases represent common area maintenance charges which have not been separated from lease components. (c) We sublease certain of our office space to third parties under our head lease. (d) Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, we incurred total rental expense of $154 million in 2018 (2017: $123 million) and income from subleases of $8 million (2017: $10 million). The above lease costs represent 100% of the lease payments due for the period, including where we as operator have contracted directly with suppliers. As the payments under lease agreements where we are operator become due, we bill our partners their proportionate share for reimbursement pursuant to the terms of our joint operating agreements. Reimbursements are not reflected in the table above. Certain lease costs above associated with exploration and development activities are included in capital expenditures. Supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows: Operating Leases Finance Leases (In millions) Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease obligations: Operating cash flows (a) $ 419 $ 21 Financing cash flows (a) — 55 Noncash transactions: Leased assets recognized for new lease obligations incurred 14 — (a) Amounts represent gross lease payments before any recovery from partners. 70 8. Debt Total debt at December 31 consisted of the following: 2019 2018 (In millions) Debt - Hess Corporation: Fixed-rate public notes: 3.5% due 2024 $ 298 $ 298 4.3% due 2027 992 992 7.9% due 2029 463 463 7.3% due 2031 628 627 7.1% due 2033 537 537 6.0% due 2040 741 740 5.6% due 2041 1,235 1,234 5.8% due 2047 494 493 Total fixed-rate public notes 5,388 5,384 Capital lease obligations (a) — 269 Financing obligations associated with floating production system (a) — 40 Fair value adjustments - interest rate hedging 1 (2 ) Total Debt - Hess Corporation $ 5,389 $ 5,691 Debt - Midstream: Fixed-rate notes: 5.6% due 2026 - Hess Midstream Operations LP $ 787 $ — Fixed-rate notes: 5.1% due 2028 - Hess Midstream Operations LP 540 — Fixed-rate notes: 5.6% due 2026 - HIP — 787 Term loan A facility - Hess Midstream Operations LP 394 — Term loan A facility - HIP — 194 Revolving credit facility - Hess Midstream Operations LP 32 — Total Debt - Midstream $ 1,753 $ 981 Total Debt: Current maturities of long-term debt $ — $ 67 Long-term debt 7,142 6,605 Total Debt $ 7,142 $ 6,672 (a) Upon adoption of ASC 842, Leases on January 1, 2019, capital lease and financing obligations previously included in Debt were reclassified to Finance leases. At December 31, 2019, the maturity profile of total debt was as follows: Total Hess Corporation Midstream (In millions) 2020 $ — $ — $ — 2021 10 — 10 2022 20 — 20 2023 30 — 30 2024 672 300 372 Thereafter 6,488 5,138 1,350 Total Borrowings 7,220 5,438 1,782 Less: Deferred issuance costs (78 ) (49 ) (29 ) Total Debt (excluding interest) $ 7,142 $ 5,389 $ 1,753 Debt – Hess Corporation: Fixed-rate public notes: At December 31, 2019, Hess Corporation’s fixed-rate public notes had a gross principal amount of $5,438 million (2018: $5,438 million) and a weighted average interest rate of 5.9% (2018: 5.9%). Our long‑term debt agreements, including the revolving credit facility, contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. The most 71 restrictive of these covenants allow us to borrow up to an additional $2,384 million of secured debt at December 31, 2019. Capitalized interest was $38 million in 2019 (2018: $20 million; 2017: $86 million). In 2018, we paid $553 million to redeem $350 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due 2019 and to purchase other notes with a carrying value of $150 million. As a result, we recorded total losses on debt extinguishment of $53 million. Concurrent with the redemption of the 2019 notes, we terminated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $350 million. Capital lease: In 2018, we entered into a sale and lease-back arrangement for an FSO to handle produced condensate at North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia (Hess operated – 50%). Pursuant to the sale agreement, we received total proceeds of approximately $260 million. No gain or loss was recognized from the sale transaction. The agreement is for 16 years with four consecutive twelve-month renewal options that may be exercised at our discretion. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the capital lease asset was $264 million and the carrying value of the capital lease obligation was $269 million, of which $15 million was included in Current maturities of long-term debt and $254 million was included in Long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit facility: In 2019, the Corporation entered into a new $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 15, 2023, which replaced the Corporation’s previous revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on January 21, 2021. The new facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the new facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above LIBOR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The facility is subject to customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization (as such terms are defined in the credit agreement for the facility) of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and customary events of default. At December 31, 2019, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant. Other outstanding letters of credit at December 31 were as follows: 2019 2018 (In millions) Committed lines (a) $ 54 $ 29 Uncommitted lines (a) 218 255 Total $ 272 $ 284 (a) At December 31, 2019, committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates throughout 2020. Debt - Midstream: Senior unsecured notes: In November 2017, HIP issued $800 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2026. In December 2019, in connection with the acquisition of HIP and corporate restructuring described in Note 6, Hess Midstream, HESM Opco assumed $800 million of outstanding HIP senior notes in a par-for-par exchange. The senior notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of HESM Opco. In addition, in December 2019, HESM Opco issued $550 million of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2028. The notes are guaranteed by HESM Opco’s direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. Proceeds of the new notes were used to finance the acquisition of HIP and repay outstanding borrowings under HIP’s credit facilities. Credit facilities: Prior to the closing of the December 2019 transaction described in Note 6, Hess Midstream, HIP had a $600 million 5-year senior secured revolving credit facility and a $200 million senior secured Term Loan A facility, while Hess Midstream Partners LP had a $300 million 4-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility. In connection with the acquisition of HIP, both HIP and Hess Midstream Partners LP retired their existing senior secured revolving credit facilities and HESM Opco entered into a new 5-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.0 billion. HIP also retired its senior secured Term Loan A facility, which had borrowings of $190 million excluding deferred issuance costs, and HESM Opco entered into a fully drawn $400 million 5-year Term Loan A facility, receiving cash of $210 million at closing. The new revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund HESM Opco’s operating activities, capital expenditures, distributions and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA as defined in the credit facilities. If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. 72 The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all the presently owned and after-acquired assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2019, borrowings of $32 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s Term Loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 9. Asset Retirement Obligations The following table describes changes to our asset retirement obligations: 2019 2018 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $ 857 $ 801 Liabilities incurred 72 68 Liabilities settled or disposed of (75 ) (46 ) Accretion expense 40 37 Revisions of estimated liabilities 129 1 Foreign currency remeasurement 1 (4 ) Balance at December 31 $ 1,024 $ 857 Total Asset Retirement Obligations at December 31: Current portion of asset retirement obligations $ 127 $ 116 Long-term asset retirement obligations 897 741 Total at December 31 $ 1,024 $ 857 The liabilities incurred in 2019 primarily relate to operations in Guyana, the U.S. and Malaysia, while liabilities incurred in 2018 primarily relate to operations in the U.S. and UK as well as acquired participating interests. The liabilities settled or disposed of primarily reflect activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken in 2019, while activity in 2018 primarily relates to abandonment activity and an asset disposal onshore in the U.S. The revisions of estimated liabilities in 2019 reflect an acceleration of planned abandonment activity in the Gulf of Mexico and changes in service and equipment rates. The fair value of sinking fund deposits that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations, which are reported in non-current Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $178 million at December 31, 2019 (2018: $148 million). 73 10. Retirement Plans We have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a significant portion of our employees. In addition, we have an unfunded supplemental pension plan covering certain employees, which provides incremental payments that would have been payable from our principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded postretirement medical plan that provides health benefits to certain qualified retirees from ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement plans is December 31. The following table summarizes the benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of our pension and postretirement medical plans: Funded Unfunded Postretirement Pension Plans Pension Plan Medical Plan 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 (In millions) Change in Benefit Obligation Balance at January 1, $ 2,492 $ 2,765 $ 216 $ 249 $ 59 $ 87 Service cost 33 30 11 12 2 2 Interest cost 82 84 7 7 2 3 Actuarial (gains) loss (a) 401 (237 ) 22 (29 ) 19 (24 ) Single premium annuity contract payment (249 ) — — — — — Benefit payments (b) (113 ) (110 ) (14 ) (19 ) (7 ) (7 ) Plan curtailments — (10 ) — (4 ) — (2 ) Plan amendments — 4 — — — — Foreign currency exchange rate changes 21 (34 ) — — — — Balance at December 31, (c) 2,667 2,492 242 216 75 59 Change in Fair Value of Plan Assets Balance at January 1, $ 2,568 $ 2,732 $ — $ — $ — $ — Actual return on plan assets 462 (77 ) — — — — Employer contributions 40 59 14 19 7 7 Single premium annuity contract payment (249 ) — — — — — Benefit payments (b) (113 ) (110 ) (14 ) (19 ) (7 ) (7 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes 24 (36 ) — — — — Balance at December 31, 2,732 2,568 — — — — Funded Status (Plan assets greater (less) than benefit obligations) at December 31, $ 65 $ 76 $ (242 ) $ (216 ) $ (75 ) $ (59 ) Unrecognized Net Actuarial (Gains) Losses $ 756 $ 778 $ 65 $ 47 $ (12 ) $ (32 ) (a) Changes in discount rates resulted in actuarial losses of approximately $465 million in 2019 (2018: $235 million of actuarial gains from changes in discount rates). (b) Benefit payments include lump-sum settlement payments of approximately $27 million in 2019 (2018: $32 million). (c) At December 31, 2019, the accumulated benefit obligation for the funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans was $2,580 million and $194 million, respectively (2018: $2,424 million and $171 million, respectively). Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31 consisted of the following: Funded Unfunded Postretirement Pension Plans Pension Plan Medical Plan 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 (In millions) Noncurrent assets $ 71 $ 76 $ — $ — $ — $ — Current liabilities — — (32 ) (30 ) (8 ) (9 ) Noncurrent liabilities (6 ) — (210 ) (186 ) (67 ) (50 ) Pension assets / (accrued benefit liability) $ 65 $ 76 $ (242 ) $ (216 ) $ (75 ) $ (59 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss, pre-tax (a) $ 756 $ 778 $ 65 $ 47 $ (12 ) $ (32 ) (a) The after‑tax deficit reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was $601 million at December 31, 2019 (2018: $581 million deficit). 74 The net periodic benefit cost for funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, is as follows: Pension Plans Postretirement Medical Plan 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Service cost $ 44 $ 42 $ 49 $ 2 $ 2 $ 4 Interest cost 89 91 102 2 3 3 Expected return on plan assets (180 ) (194 ) (168 ) — — — Amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses (gains) 52 39 58 (1 ) (2 ) — Settlement loss 93 4 19 — — — Curtailment gain — — — — (2 ) — Net Periodic Benefit Cost (a) $ 98 $ (18 ) $ 60 $ 3 $ 1 $ 7 (a) Net non-service pension costs are included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2019, net non-service pension costs amounted to an expense of $55 million (2018: $61 million of income; 2017: $14 million of expense). In 2019, the trust for the Hess Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan (the “Plan”) purchased a single premium annuity contract at a cost of approximately $250 million using assets of the Plan to settle and transfer certain of its obligations to a third party. The settlement transaction resulted in a noncash charge of $88 million to recognize unamortized pension actuarial losses that is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In connection with this settlement transaction, as required under U.S. accounting standards, we remeasured the Plan, which resulted in a net increase in Plan liabilities of $239 million driven by a change in the weighted average discount rate used and an update to the fair value of Plan assets. In 2020, we forecast pension service costs for our pension and postretirement medical plans to be approximately $55 million and net non-service pension costs of approximately $55 million of income, which is comprised of interest cost of approximately $75 million, amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses of approximately $50 million, and estimated expected return on plan assets of approximately $180 million. Assumptions: The weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine Benefit obligations at December 31 and Net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended December 31 for our funded and unfunded pension plans were as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Benefit Obligations: Discount rate 2.9 % 3.9 % 3.3 % Rate of compensation increase 3.8 % 3.8 % 4.5 % Net Periodic Benefit Cost: Discount rate Service cost 3.9 % 3.9 % 3.7 % Interest cost 3.4 % 3.3 % 3.7 % Expected return on plan assets 7.1 % 7.2 % 7.3 % Rate of compensation increase 3.8 % 4.5 % 4.6 % The actuarial assumptions used to determine Benefit obligations at December 31 for the postretirement medical plan were as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Discount rate 2.8 % 3.9 % 3.2 % Initial health care trend rate 6.5 % 6.9 % 7.3 % Ultimate trend rate 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2038 2038 2038 The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year‑end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. Beginning in 2018, we elected to use a split discount rate approach for all of our retirement plans. This involves the continued use of a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation, and separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of service cost and interest cost. In contrast, historically, a single weighted-average discount rate was used in both the calculation of the projected benefit obligation, and service cost and interest cost. The overall expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset 75 categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. Our investment strategy is to maximize long‑term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes. Asset classes and target allocations are determined by our investment committee and include domestic and foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities issued by us unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets are highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements. The current target allocations for plan assets are 45% equity securities, 35% fixed income securities (including cash and short‑term investment funds) and 20% to all other types of investments. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target levels. Fair value: The following tables provide the fair value of the financial assets of the funded pension plans at December 31, 2019 and 2018 in accordance with the fair value measurement hierarchy described in Note 1, Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies. Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Net Asset Value (d) Total (In millions) December 31, 2019 Cash and Short-Term Investment Funds $ 57 $ — $ — $ — $ 57 Equities: U.S. equities (domestic) 638 — — — 638 International equities (non-U.S.) 80 37 — 302 419 Global equities (domestic and non-U.S.) — 8 — 196 204 Fixed Income: Treasury and government issued (a) — 210 — — 210 Government related (b) — 162 — 56 218 Mortgage-backed securities (c) — 141 — 30 171 Corporate — 293 — 82 375 Other: Hedge funds — — — 65 65 Private equity funds — — — 191 191 Real estate funds 27 — — 157 184 Total investments $ 802 $ 851 $ — $ 1,079 $ 2,732 December 31, 2018 Cash and Short-Term Investment Funds $ 3 $ 47 $ — $ — $ 50 Equities: U.S. equities (domestic) 654 — — — 654 International equities (non-U.S.) 92 29 — 288 409 Global equities (domestic and non-U.S.) 2 203 — — 205 Fixed Income: Treasury and government issued (a) — 240 — — 240 Government related (b) — 37 — — 37 Mortgage-backed securities (c) — 159 — 27 186 Corporate — 272 — 31 303 Other: Hedge funds — — — 135 135 Private equity funds — — — 170 170 Real estate funds 49 — — 111 160 Diversified commodities funds — 19 — — 19 Total investments $ 800 $ 1,006 $ — $ 762 $ 2,568 (a) Includes securities issued and guaranteed by U.S. and non‑U.S. governments. (b) Primarily consists of securities issued by governmental agencies and municipalities. (c) Comprised of U.S. residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. (d) Includes certain investments that have been valued using the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient, and therefore have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The inclusion of such amounts in the above table is intended to aid reconciliation of investments categorized in the fair value hierarchy to total pension plan assets. In 2019, we elected to apply the NAV practical expedient to the plan’s investments in non-exchange traded Real Estate Funds and, as such, have presented investments in Real Estate Funds that were previously categorized as Level 3 at December 31, 2018 totaling $61 million on a basis consistent with 2019. 76 The following describes the financial assets of the funded pension plans: Cash and short‑term investment funds - Consists of cash on hand and short-term investment funds that provide for daily investments and redemptions which are classified as Level 1. Equities - Consists of individually held U.S. and International equity securities. This investment category also includes funds that consist primarily U.S. and international equity securities. Equity securities, which are individually held and are traded actively on exchanges, are classified as Level 1. Certain funds, consisting primarily of equity securities, are classified as Level 2 if the NAV is determined and published daily, and is the basis for current transactions. Commingled funds, consisting primarily of equity securities, are valued using the NAV per fund share. Fixed income investments - Consists of individually held securities issued by the U.S. government, non-U.S. governments, governmental agencies, municipalities and corporations, and agency and non-agency mortgage backed securities. This investment category also includes funds that consist of fixed income securities. Individual fixed income securities are generally priced based on evaluated prices from independent pricing services, which are monitored and provided by the third-party custodial firm responsible for safekeeping assets of the particular plan and are classified as Level 2. Certain funds, consisting primarily of fixed income securities, are classified as Level 2 if the NAV is determined and published daily, and is the basis for current transactions. Commingled funds, consisting primarily of fixed income securities, are valued using the NAV per fund share. Other investments - Consists of exchange‑traded real estate investment trust securities, which are classified as Level 1. Commingled funds and limited partnership investments in hedge funds, private equity and real estate funds are valued at the NAV per fund share. Contributions and estimated future benefit payments: We expect to contribute approximately $45 million to our funded pension plans in 2020. Estimated future benefit payments by the funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, which reflect expected future service, are as follows (in millions): 2020 $ 127 2021 126 2022 128 2023 130 2024 133 Years 2025 to 2029 674 We also have defined contribution plans for certain eligible employees. Employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to these plans and we match a portion of the employee contributions. We recorded expense of $20 million in 2019 for contributions to these plans (2018: $19 million; 2017: $22 million). 77 11. Share-based Compensation We have established and maintain long term incentive plans (LTIP) for the granting of restricted common shares (Restricted stock), PSUs and stock options to our employees. At December 31, 2019, the total number of authorized common stock under the LTIP was 51.5 million shares, of which we have 16.4 million shares available for issuance. Share‑based compensation expense consisted of the following: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Restricted stock $ 53 $ 40 $ 56 Stock options 10 10 9 Performance share units 22 22 21 Share-based compensation expense before income taxes $ 85 $ 72 $ 86 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation expense $ — $ — $ 1 Based on share‑based compensation awards outstanding at December 31, 2019, unearned compensation expense, before income taxes, will be recognized in future years as follows (in millions): 2020: $53, 2021: $29 and 2022: $4. Our share-based compensation plans can be summarized as follows: Restricted stock: Restricted stock generally vests equally on an annual basis over a three-year term and are valued based on the prevailing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The following is a summary of restricted stock award activity in 2019: Shares of Restricted Common Stock Weighted - Average Price on Date of Grant (In thousands, except per share amounts) Outstanding at January 1, 2019 2,881 $ 48.70 Granted 965 56.87 Vested (a) (1,742 ) 47.35 Forfeited (90 ) 52.67 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 2,014 $ 53.61 (a) In 2019, restricted stock with fair values of $102 million were vested (2018: $54 million; 2017: $37 million). PSUs: PSUs generally vest three years from the date of grant and are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant. The number of shares of common stock to be issued under a PSU agreement is based on a comparison of the Corporation’s total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies over a three‑year performance period ending December 31 of the year prior to settlement of the grant. Payouts of the performance share awards will range from 0% to 200% of the target awards based on the Corporation’s TSR ranking within the peer group. Dividend equivalents for the performance period will accrue on performance shares but will only be paid out on earned shares after the performance period. The following is a summary of PSU activity in 2019: Performance Share Units Weighted - Average Fair Value on Date of Grant (In thousands, except per share amounts) Outstanding at January 1, 2019 1,063 $ 53.98 Granted 269 68.87 Vested (a) (391 ) 51.00 Forfeited (12 ) 52.05 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 929 $ 59.57 (a) In 2019, PSU’s with fair value of $16 million were vested (2018: $9 million; 2017: $10 million). The following weighted average assumptions were utilized to estimate the fair value of PSU awards: 2019 2018 2017 Risk free interest rate 2.48 % 2.39 % 1.55 % Stock price volatility 0.369 0.400 0.387 Contractual term in years 3.0 3.0 3.0 Grant date price of Hess common stock $ 56.74 $ 48.48 $ 51.03 78 Stock options: Stock options vest over three years from the date of grant, have a 10‑year term, and the exercise price equals the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The following is a summary of stock options activity in 2019: Number of options (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term Outstanding at January 1, 2019 5,170 $ 61.91 4.3 years Granted 527 56.74 Exercised (744 ) 54.23 Forfeited (652 ) 57.69 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 4,301 $ 63.24 4.8 years At December 31, 2019, there were 4.3 million outstanding stock options (3.1 million exercisable) with a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.8 years (3.4 years for exercisable options) and an aggregated intrinsic value of $39 million ($22 million for exercisable options). The following weighted average assumptions were utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options: 2019 2018 2017 Risk free interest rate 2.55 % 2.74 % 2.17 % Stock price volatility 0.359 0.322 0.333 Dividend yield 1.76 % 2.06 % 1.96 % Expected life in years 6.0 6.0 6.0 Weighted average fair value per option granted $ 18.08 $ 13.69 $ 14.51 In estimating the fair value of PSUs and stock options, the risk-free interest rate is based on the vesting period of the award and is obtained from published sources. The stock price volatility is determined from the historical stock prices of the Corporation using the expected term. 12. Exit and Disposal Costs In 2018, we incurred severance expense of $38 million (2017: $18 million) associated with asset sales and cost savings initiatives in response to low crude oil prices. In 2019, we paid accrued severance costs of $4 million (2018: $40 million; 2017: $48 million). 13. Impairment In the third quarter of 2017, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $2,503 million ($550 million after income taxes) to impair the carrying value of our interests in Norway based on an anticipated sale of the asset, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 3, Dispositions. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the Stampede Field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the Tubular Bells Field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The Stampede Field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the Pony discovery prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. These impairment charges were based on a total fair value estimate of approximately $1.1 billion that was determined using internal projected discounted cash flows. The determination of projected discounted cash flows depended on estimates of oil and gas reserves, future prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, discount rate and timing of future net cash flows. Each of the valuation methods used in the determination of the impairment charges above represent Level 3 fair value measurements. 79 14. Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) United States Federal Current $ (1 ) $ 1 $ (23 ) Deferred taxes and other accruals 72 (74 ) (6 ) State 16 (45 ) — 87 (118 ) (29 ) Foreign Current (a) 447 455 179 Deferred taxes and other accruals (73 ) (2 ) (1,987 ) 374 453 (1,808 ) Total Provision (Benefit) For Income Taxes $ 461 $ 335 $ (1,837 ) (a) Primarily comprised of Libya in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) United States (a) $ (338 ) $ (219 ) $ (2,784 ) Foreign 559 439 (2,994 ) Total Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ 221 $ 220 $ (5,778 ) (a) Includes substantially all of our interest expense, corporate expense and the results of commodity hedging activities. The difference between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate is reconciled below: 2019 2018 2017 U.S. statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 35.0 % Effect of foreign operations (a) 142.9 141.2 17.4 State income taxes, net of Federal income tax 5.8 (18.9 ) — Change in enacted tax laws (b) — — (23.6 ) Valuation allowance adjustment with tax law change (b) — — 23.6 Rate differential on U.S. loss — — (4.1 ) Gains on asset sales, net — — (2.2 ) Valuation allowance on current year operations 41.8 55.2 (14.9 ) Valuation allowance against previously benefited deferred tax assets — — 0.1 Release valuation allowance against previously unbenefited deferred tax assets (24.5 ) — — Noncontrolling interests in Midstream (16.0 ) (15.9 ) 0.8 Intraperiod allocation 33.7 (37.3 ) — Equity and executive compensation 2.2 7.4 (0.3 ) Other 1.2 (0.3 ) — Total 208.1 % 152.4 % 31.8 % (a) The variance in effective income tax rates attributable to the effect of foreign operations primarily resulted from the mix of income among high, primarily Libya, and low tax rate jurisdictions. (b) The enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided for a decrease in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and a change to a territorial tax regime, resulting in a net $1,336 million reduction to our U.S. net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017, with a corresponding reduction in the previously established U.S. valuation allowance. 80 The components of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets at December 31 were as follows: 2019 2018 (In millions) Deferred Tax Liabilities Property, plant and equipment and investments $ (1,318 ) $ (853 ) Other (45 ) (77 ) Total Deferred Tax Liabilities (1,363 ) (930 ) Deferred Tax Assets Net operating loss carryforwards 4,733 4,239 Tax credit carryforwards 66 134 Property, plant and equipment and investments 206 416 Accrued compensation, deferred credits and other liabilities 179 232 Asset retirement obligations 261 225 Other 317 161 Total Deferred Tax Assets 5,762 5,407 Valuation allowances (a) (4,734 ) (4,877 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 1,028 530 Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) $ (335 ) $ (400 ) (a) In 2019, the valuation allowance decreased by $143 million (2018: decrease of $322 million; 2017: decrease of $251 million). In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted by taxing jurisdiction and are recorded at December 31 as follows: 2019 2018 (In millions) Deferred income taxes (long-term asset) $ 80 $ 21 Deferred income taxes (long-term liability) (415 ) (421 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities) $ (335 ) $ (400 ) At December 31, 2019, we have recognized a gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards of $4,733 million before application of valuation allowances. The deferred tax asset is comprised of $1,447 million attributable to foreign net operating losses which begin to expire in 2025, $2,746 million attributable to U.S. Federal operating losses which begin to expire in 2034, and $540 million attributable to losses in various U.S. states which begin to expire in 2020. The deferred tax asset attributable to foreign net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, is $110 million. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to U.S. Federal and state net operating losses. At December 31, 2019, we have U.S. Federal, state and foreign alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $49 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely, and approximately $15 million of other business credit carryforwards. The deferred tax asset attributable to these credits, net of valuation allowances was not significant. A full valuation allowance is established against our foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3 million, which begin to expire in 2021. At December 31, 2019, the Balance Sheet reflects a $4,734 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on application of the relevant accounting standards. Hess continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia, and Guyana (until December 2019). Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. The cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ending December 31, 2019 constitutes significant objective negative evidence. Such objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider subjective positive evidence, such as our projections of future taxable income, resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for these jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence. At December 31, 2019 the valuation allowance established against the net deferred tax asset in Guyana for the Stabroek Block was released as a result of the positive evidence from first production in December 2019, and the significant forecasted pre-tax income from operations. The cumulative pre-tax losses in Guyana were driven by pre-production activities. 81 Below is a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Balance at January 1 $ 168 $ 205 $ 424 Additions based on tax positions taken in the current year 2 19 14 Additions based on tax positions of prior years 1 36 4 Reductions based on tax positions of prior years (1 ) (78 ) (147 ) Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities — (10 ) (85 ) Reductions due to lapses in statutes of limitation (2 ) (4 ) (5 ) Balance at December 31 $ 168 $ 168 $ 205 The December 31, 2019 balance of unrecognized tax benefits includes $7 million that, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between $4 million and $11 million due to settlements with taxing authorities or other resolutions, as well as lapses in statutes of limitation. At December 31, 2019, our accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is $7 million (2018: $3 million). We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to examinations by income tax authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2011. 15. Outstanding and Weighted Average Common Shares The Net income (loss) and weighted average number of common shares used in basic and diluted earnings per share computation were as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions except per share amounts) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Common Stockholders: Net income (loss) $ (240 ) $ (115 ) $ (3,941 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 168 167 133 Less: Preferred stock dividends 4 46 46 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation Common Stockholders $ (412 ) $ (328 ) $ (4,120 ) Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding: Basic 301.2 298.2 314.1 Effect of dilutive securities Restricted common stock — — — Stock options — — — Performance share units — — — Mandatory convertible preferred stock — — — Diluted 301.2 298.2 314.1 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation per Common Share: Basic $ (1.37 ) $ (1.10 ) $ (13.12 ) Diluted $ (1.37 ) $ (1.10 ) $ (13.12 ) Antidilutive shares excluded from the computation of diluted shares: Restricted common stock 2.2 2.9 3.3 Stock options 4.7 5.5 6.4 Performance share units 1.7 1.1 0.6 Common shares from conversion of preferred stock — 12.7 12.8 82 The following table provides the changes in our outstanding common shares: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Balance at January 1 291.4 315.1 316.5 Conversion of preferred stock 11.6 — — Activity related to restricted stock awards, net 0.9 0.8 0.8 Stock options exercised 0.7 0.6 0.2 PSU vested 0.3 0.1 0.2 Shares repurchased — (25.2 ) (2.6 ) Balance at December 31 304.9 291.4 315.1 Common and Preferred Stock Issuance: In February 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock), par value $1 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for total net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses. The dividends on the Preferred Stock were payable on a cumulative basis. Unless converted earlier, each share of Preferred Stock would automatically convert into between 21.822 shares and 25.642 shares of our common stock based on the volume weighted average share price (“VWAP”) over a period of twenty-consecutive trading days ending January 28, 2019, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. We also entered into capped call transactions on 12.55 million covered shares that were expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock if the VWAP for any individual day during the period of twenty consecutive trading days ending January 28, 2019 exceeded $45.83 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. On January 31, 2019, the Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of common stock at a rate of 21.822 shares of common stock per share of Preferred Stock. In total, the Preferred Stock was converted into approximately 12.5 million shares of common stock and the Company received approximately 0.9 million shares of common stock upon settlement of the capped call transactions. As a result, the net number of common shares issued by the Company upon conversion of the Preferred Stock was approximately 11.6 million shares. Common Stock Repurchase Plan: In 2018, we repurchased 25.2 million shares of our common stock (2017: 2.6 million shares) for $1,380 million (2017: $120 million), at an average cost per share of $54.85 (2017: $45.67). At December 31, 2019, we are authorized, but not required, to purchase additional common stock up to a value of $650 million. Common stock dividends: In 2019, 2018 and 2017, cash dividends declared on common stock totaled $1.00 per share ($0.25 per quarter). 83 16. Supplementary Cash Flow Information The following information supplements the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Cash Flows From Operating Activities Interest paid $ (380 ) $ (394 ) $ (314 ) Net income taxes (paid) refunded (417 ) (463 ) (210 ) Cash Flows From Investing Activities Additions to property, plant and equipment - E&P: Capital expenditures incurred - E&P $ (2,576 ) $ (1,909 ) $ (1,852 ) Increase (decrease) in related liabilities 143 55 64 Additions to property, plant and equipment - E&P $ (2,433 ) $ (1,854 ) $ (1,788 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment - Midstream: Capital expenditures incurred - Midstream $ (416 ) $ (271 ) $ (121 ) Increase (decrease) in related liabilities 20 28 (28 ) Additions to property, plant and equipment - Midstream $ (396 ) $ (243 ) $ (149 ) In December 2019, as part of HESM Opco’s acquisition of HIP (see Note 6, Hess Midstream), HESM Opco assumed $800 million of outstanding HIP notes (see Note 8, Debt). 17. Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments Guarantees and Contingencies We are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are three remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Rhode Island is proceeding in Federal court. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to Federal court by the defendants. In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and agreed with the EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, 84 the Federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages. In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. The remedy selected by the EPA includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. The EPA’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA’s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2020. The costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments The following table shows aggregate information for certain unconditional purchase obligations and commitments at December 31, 2019, which are not included elsewhere within these Consolidated Financial Statements: Payments Due by Period 2021 and 2023 and Total 2020 2022 2024 Thereafter (In millions) Capital expenditures $ 1,743 $ 913 $ 755 $ 75 $ — Operating expenses 190 158 20 9 3 Transportation and related contracts 1,009 231 424 246 108 85 18. Segment Information We currently have two operating segments, E&P and Midstream. The E&P operating segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases and sells crude oil, NGL and natural gas. Production operations over the three years ended December 31, 2019 were primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, the JDA and Malaysia, and from divested assets, including Equatorial Guinea (until November 2017) and Norway (until December 2017). The Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of NGL, transportation of crude oil by rail car, terminaling and loading crude oil and NGL, storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota. All unallocated costs are reflected under Corporate, Interest and Other.

In 2018 and 2017, the provision for income taxes in the Midstream segment was presented before consolidating its operations with other U.S. activities of the Corporation and prior to evaluating realizability of net U.S. deferred taxes. An offsetting impact was presented in the E&P segment. If 2018 and 2017 segment results were prepared on a basis consistent with 2019, Midstream segment net income attributable to Hess Corporation would have been $158 million and $73 million, respectively, and E&P net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation would have been income of $13 million and a loss of $3,684 million, respectively. 86 The following table presents financial information by major geographic area: United States Europe Africa Asia and Other Countries Corporate, Interest and other Total (In millions) 2019 Sales and Other Operating Revenues $ 5,043 $ 139 $ 551 $ 762 $ — $ 6,495 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation 15 2 36 144 (605 ) (408 ) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 1,631 53 21 414 3 2,122 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes — 1 425 (51 ) 86 461 Identifiable Assets 14,234 1,070 399 4,586 1,493 21,782 Property, Plant and Equipment (Net) 12,182 871 350 3,399 12 16,814 Capital Expenditures 2,094 40 15 843 — 2,992 2018 Sales and Other Operating Revenues $ 4,842 $ 164 $ 548 $ 769 $ — $ 6,323 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation 131 42 36 (38 ) (453 ) (282 ) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 1,424 37 19 395 8 1,883 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes (25 ) 15 430 9 (94 ) 335 Identifiable Assets 13,250 1,033 395 4,716 2,039 21,433 Property, Plant and Equipment (Net) 11,653 906 355 3,154 15 16,083 Capital Expenditures 1,543 8 9 620 — 2,180 2017 Sales and Other Operating Revenues $ 3,692 $ 629 $ 675 $ 470 $ — $ 5,466 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation (2,433 ) (1,383 ) 259 (54 ) (463 ) (4,074 ) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 1,942 381 263 273 24 2,883 Impairment 1,700 2,503 — — — 4,203 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes — (1,999 ) 197 (9 ) (26 ) (1,837 ) Capital Expenditures 1,387 141 30 415 — 1,973 19. Financial Risk Management Activities In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, corporate financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. We maintain a control environment for all of our financial risk management activities under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Corporate Financial Risk Management Activities: Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas we produce or by reducing our exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to fix the forward selling price of a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we conduct business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. At December 31, 2019, these forward contracts relate to the British Pound and the Danish Krone. Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates. The notional amounts of outstanding financial risk management derivative contracts were as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 (In millions) Commodity - crude oil (millions of barrels) 54.9 34.7 Foreign exchange $ 90 $ 16 Interest rate swaps $ 100 $ 100 For calendar year 2020 we have West Texas Intermediate (WTI) put options with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 130,000 bopd, and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 20,000 bopd. 87 The table below reflects the gross and net fair values of risk management derivative instruments and their respective financial statement caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet: Assets Liabilities (In millions) December 31, 2019 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments: Commodity - Other current assets $ 125 $ — Interest rate - Other assets (noncurrent) 1 — Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments 126 — Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments: Foreign exchange — (1 ) Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments — (1 ) Gross fair value of derivative contracts 126 (1 ) Master netting arrangements — — Net Fair Value of Derivative Contracts $ 126 $ (1 ) December 31, 2018 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments: Commodity - Other current assets $ 484 $ — Interest rate - Other liabilities and deferred credits (noncurrent) — (2 ) Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments 484 (2 ) Gross fair value of derivative contracts 484 (2 ) Master netting arrangements — — Net Fair Value of Derivative Contracts $ 484 $ (2 ) All fair values above are based on Level 2 inputs. Impact on statement of consolidated income from derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments: Crude oil derivatives: In 2019, crude oil price hedging contracts increased Sales and other operating revenues by $1 million (2018: decrease of $161 million; 2017: decrease of $34 million). At December 31, 2019, pre-tax deferred losses in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to outstanding crude oil price hedging contracts were $98 million, of which all will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: At December 31, 2019, we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $100 million (2018: $100 million), which were designated as fair value hedges and relate to debt where we have converted interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and the hedged fixed‑rate debt are recorded in Interest expense in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2019, the change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a decrease in the derivative liability of $3 million (2018: $1 million increase in liability; 2017: $4 million increase in liability) with a corresponding adjustment in the carrying value of the hedged fixed‑rate debt. During 2018, we terminated interest rate swaps with a gross notional amount of $350 million and paid $3 million. Impact on statement of consolidated income from derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments: Crude oil collars: In 2018, noncash adjustments to de-designated crude oil price hedging contracts decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $22 million (2017: decrease of $25 million). Foreign exchange: Total foreign exchange gains and losses were a gain of $3 million in 2019 (2018: loss of $5 million; 2017: gain of $15 million) and are reported in Other, net in Revenues and non-operating income in the Statement of Consolidated Income. A component of foreign exchange gains or losses is the result of foreign exchange derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges, which amounted to a loss of $2 million in 2019 (2018: loss of $2 million; 2017: gain of $3 million). In 2017, after‑tax foreign currency translation adjustments included in the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income amounted to gains of $144 million. In addition, $900 million of cumulative currency translation losses were recognized in earnings as a result of the sale of our assets in Norway. See Note 3, Dispositions. Credit Risk: We are exposed to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, groups of counterparties or customers. Accounts receivable are generated from a diverse domestic and international customer base. At December 31, 2019, our Accounts receivable were concentrated with the following counterparty industry segments: Integrated companies — 41%, Independent E&P companies — 26%, Refining and marketing companies — 14%, National oil companies — 8%, Storage and transportation companies — 5%, and Others — 6%. We reduce risk related to certain counterparties, where applicable, by using master netting arrangements and requiring collateral, generally cash or letters of credit. 88 At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $272 million (2018: $284 million). Fair Value Measurement: At December 31, 2019, our total long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments, had a carrying value of $7,142 million and a fair value of $8,242 million, based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. We also have short-term financial instruments, primarily cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, for which the carrying value approximated fair value at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 20. Subsequent Event In January 2020, the operator, Kosmos Energy Ltd, completed drilling of the Oldfield-1 exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico. The well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and 2019 results include $15 million in exploration expense for well costs incurred through December 31, 2019. We estimate approximately $15 million of exploration expense will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020 for well costs incurred after December 31, 2019. 89 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DATA (UNAUDITED) The Supplementary Oil and Gas Data that follows is presented in accordance with ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities, and includes (1) costs incurred, capitalized costs and results of operations relating to oil and gas producing activities, (2) net proved oil and gas reserves and (3) a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves, including a reconciliation of changes therein. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, we produced crude oil, NGL and natural gas principally in the United States (U.S.), Europe (Denmark and Norway until December 2017), Africa (Libya and Equatorial Guinea until November 2017) and Asia and Other (primarily the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia). Exploration and/or development activities were also conducted, or are planned, in certain of these producing areas as well as offshore Guyana, Suriname and Canada.

Proved oil and gas reserves are quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by our internal teams of geoscience and reservoir engineering professionals. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007).” The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir, the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate, the stage of reservoir development and the production history. Where applicable, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC regulations. These technologies, including computational methods, must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In order for reserves to be classified as proved, any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project, either senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the development. Our proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10‑K. Internal Controls The Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation processes, which are administered by our Global Reserves group and our Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff who work directly with the oil and gas properties using industry standard reserve estimation principles, definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates of the Corporation’s assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an independent third-party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves (see pages 92 through 97). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors. Qualifications The person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves during 2019 was Mr. Kenneth Kosco, Senior Manager, Global Reserves. Mr. Kosco is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has over 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a BS degree in Petroleum Engineering. His experience has been primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas. Mr. Kosco is responsible for the Corporation’s Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization responsible for establishing the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews. Reserves Audit We engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 80% of 2019 year‑end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (2018: 80%). The purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D&M letter report, dated February 5, 2020, on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry. D&M is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. D&M’s letter report on the Corporation’s December 31, 2019 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this Form 10‑K. While the D&M report should be read in its entirety, the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M, the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and audited by D&M, in the aggregate, differed by less than 1% (2018: less than 1%) of total audited net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The report also includes among other information, the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve audit. Crude Oil Prices Used to Estimate Proved Reserves Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period before December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2019 were $55.73 per barrel for WTI (2018: $65.55; 2017: $51.19) and $62.54 per barrel for Brent (2018: $72.08; 2017: $54.87). New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were $2.54 per mcf in 2019 (2018: $3.01; 2017: $3.03). 92 At December 31, 2019, spot prices for WTI oil closed at $61 per barrel. If crude oil prices during 2020 average below those used in determining 2019 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2020, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing cost structures. Conversely, if crude oil prices in 2020 remain above those used in determining 2019 proved reserves, we could recognize positive revisions to our proved reserves at December 31, 2020. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2020, due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2020 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2020 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices.

Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 207 million boe (122 million barrels of crude oil, 39 million barrels of NGL and 274 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 96. 2017: Total Additions were 291 million boe, of which 11 million boe (4 million barrels of crude oil, 1 million barrels of NGL and 37 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken and North Malay Basin. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 280 million boe (170 million barrels of crude oil, 49 million barrels of NGL and 365 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 96. 94 Revisions of previous estimates 2019: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net decrease of 107 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net decrease of 19 million boe (NGL - 7 million barrels decrease and natural gas - 72 million mcf decrease). Revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken were a net decrease of 25 million boe with approximately 80% relating to changes in expected recoveries of NGL and natural gas and approximately 20% relating to the impact of lower prices. Net revisions from international assets were an increase of 6 million boe. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 96. 2018: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net decrease of 41 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 3 million boe (crude oil - 4 million barrels increase, NGL - 4 million barrels decrease and natural gas - 20 million mcf increase). Revisions to proved developed reserves primarily relate to the Bakken. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 96. 2017: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net increase of 106 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 126 million boe (41 million barrels of crude oil, 44 million barrels of NGL and 243 million mcf of natural gas). Revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken amounted to 85 million boe with approximately 55% resulting from improved reservoir performance, and the remaining 45% resulting from higher prices and an improved cost structure. The Gulf of Mexico and Utica had positive revisions to proved developed reserves totaling 16 million boe due to improved reservoir performance, while higher crude oil prices resulted in revisions to proved developed reserves of 15 million boe in Denmark and Utica. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 96. Sales of minerals in place (‘Asset sales’) 2018: Asset sales primarily include our former interests in the Utica Basin of Ohio. 2017: Asset sales primarily include our former interests in Norway, Equatorial Guinea, and our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin. Proved Undeveloped Reserves Following are the Corporation’s proved undeveloped reserves: United States Europe Africa Asia & Other Total (Millions of boe) Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 1, 2017 168 115 26 1 310 Revisions of previous estimates (8 ) (3 ) (9 ) — (20 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 209 3 — 68 280 Transfers to proved developed reserves (32 ) — — — (32 ) Sales of minerals in place — (109 ) — — (109 ) At December 31, 2017 337 6 17 69 429 Revisions of previous estimates (22 ) (7 ) (6 ) (9 ) (44 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 178 2 8 19 207 Transfers to proved developed reserves (97 ) — (2 ) — (99 ) Sales of minerals in place (7 ) — — — (7 ) At December 31, 2018 389 1 17 79 486 Revisions of previous estimates (91 ) — (6 ) 9 (88 ) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 154 10 5 34 203 Transfers to proved developed reserves (108 ) — (2 ) (33 ) (143 ) At December 31, 2019 344 11 14 89 458 Extensions, discoveries and other additions (‘Additions’) 2019: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 154 million boe, of which approximately 25% of the change results from additional planned wells to be drilled in the next five years, and approximately 75% results from new wells moved into the five-year plan associated with optimization of drilling 95 locations. Additions in Asia and Other totaling 34 million boe are from the sanction of Phase 2 at Liza Field on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. Other international additions were at the South Arne Field in Denmark and in Libya due to additional planned wells to be drilled. 2018: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 168 million boe, of which approximately 40% of the change results from additional planned wells to be drilled in the next five years, approximately 35% results from performance associated with improved well completion designs, and approximately 25% results from other changes, primarily the impact of higher crude oil prices. Additions in the Gulf of Mexico were 10 million boe due to additional planned drilling at the Tubular Bells Field. Additions in Asia include 11 million boe at North Malay Basin and 8 million boe at the JDA relating to additional planned wells to be drilled within the next five years. 2017: In the United States, additions from the Bakken were 180 million boe, of which approximately 70% resulted from higher crude oil prices that increased the percentage of proved undeveloped wells in our planned five-year drilling program compared with the prior year. The remaining 30% of Bakken additions reflect the expected improved recovery in future wells from changes in well completion design and reservoir performance. Additions from the Stampede Field in the Gulf of Mexico were 21 million boe, due to completion of further development activities. At the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, additions of 45 million boe were recognized for project sanction of the first phase of the Liza Field development. Other international additions were primarily at North Malay Basin due to higher prices. Revisions of previous estimates 2019: Negative reserve revisions in the United States of 91 million boe were largely from the Bakken (94 million boe), of which approximately 75% resulted from wells moved outside our five-year plan associated with optimization of drilling locations. The remaining 25% of negative revisions in the Bakken were caused by lower commodity prices. The net positive reserve revisions in Asia and Other of 9 million boe relate to the Liza Phase 1 development, offshore Guyana, including the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing agreement. 2018: Negative reserve revisions in the United States totaling 22 million boe, primarily resulted from optimizing drilling plans at the Bakken. Negative reserve revisions in international assets primarily resulted from updates in drilling plans in Denmark and North Malay Basin, and the impact of crude oil price changes on our PSC in Guyana. 2017: Total negative reserve revisions of 20 million boe, primarily relate to changes in drilling plans in Libya and lower reserves at certain fields in the Gulf of Mexico and Denmark. Transfers to proved developed reserves (‘Transfers’) 2019: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 100 million boe in the Bakken associated with drilling activity, 30 million boe at the Stabroek Block in Guyana where first production was achieved in 2019, and 8 million boe at the Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico associated with drilling activity. 2018: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 75 million boe in the Bakken associated with drilling activity, and 22 million boe at the Stampede Field in the Gulf of Mexico where first production was achieved in 2018. 2017: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 24 million boe in the Bakken and 8 million boe at the Penn State Field in the Gulf of Mexico associated with drilling activity. In 2019, capital expenditures of $1,750 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (2018: $1,070 million; 2017: $527 million). At December 31, 2019, projects that have proved reserves that have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess of five years total 3 million boe, or less than 1% of total proved reserves, primarily related to Libya. 96 Production Sharing Contracts The Corporation’s proved reserves include crude oil and natural gas reserves relating to long‑term agreements with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the legal right to produce or has a revenue interest in the production. Proved reserves from these production sharing contracts for each of the three years ended December 31, 2019 are presented separately below, as well as volumes produced and received during 2019, 2018 and 2017 from these production sharing contracts.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves Future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining year‑end reserve estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development and production costs, which are based on year‑end costs and existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year‑end statutory tax rates to the pre‑tax net cash flows, as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%. The prices used for the discounted future net cash flows in 2019 were $55.73 per barrel for WTI (2018: $65.55; 2017: $51.19) and $62.54 per barrel for Brent (2018: $72.08; 2017: $54.87) and do not include the effects of commodity hedges. NYMEX natural gas prices used were $2.54 per mcf in 2019 (2018: $3.01; 2017: $3.03). Selling prices have in the past, and can in the future, fluctuate significantly. As a result, selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices. In addition, the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The amount of tax deductions, credits, and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves, variances in actual pre-tax cash flows from forecasted pre-tax cash flows in historical periods, and the impact to year-end carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the Corporation’s income tax returns exploration expenses, interest expense, and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not contemplated in the standardized measure computations. The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used. 97 At December 31 Total United States Europe Africa Asia & Other (In millions) 2019 Future revenues $ 44,778 $ 25,223 $ 2,719 $ 8,037 $ 8,799 Less: Future production costs 14,176 10,189 1,178 640 2,169 Future development costs 8,267 5,104 490 301 2,372 Future income tax expenses 8,560 1,291 209 6,393 667 31,003 16,584 1,877 7,334 5,208 Future net cash flows 13,775 8,639 842 703 3,591 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate 5,390 3,872 376 333 809 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows $ 8,385 $ 4,767 $ 466 $ 370 $ 2,782 2018 Future revenues $ 50,948 $ 31,460 $ 3,036 $ 9,183 $ 7,269 Less: Future production costs 13,636 9,718 1,311 678 1,929 Future development costs 8,427 6,132 449 301 1,545 Future income tax expenses 10,950 2,641 246 7,496 567 33,013 18,491 2,006 8,475 4,041 Future net cash flows 17,935 12,969 1,030 708 3,228 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate 7,285 5,437 444 359 1,045 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows $ 10,650 $ 7,532 $ 586 $ 349 $ 2,183 2017 Future revenues $ 36,746 $ 20,834 $ 2,958 $ 7,154 $ 5,800 Less: Future production costs 13,042 8,802 1,501 782 1,957 Future development costs 6,748 4,601 553 330 1,264 Future income tax expenses 6,379 444 137 5,485 313 26,169 13,847 2,191 6,597 3,534 Future net cash flows 10,577 6,987 767 557 2,266 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate 4,221 2,904 272 307 738 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows $ 6,356 $ 4,083 $ 495 $ 250 $ 1,528 Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves For the Years Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at January 1 $ 10,650 $ 6,356 $ 4,025 Changes during the year: Sales and transfers of oil and gas produced during the year, net of production costs (2,842 ) (2,755 ) (2,216 ) Development costs incurred during the year 2,262 1,533 1,679 Net changes in prices and production costs applicable to production (5,761 ) 7,076 2,330 Net change in estimated future development costs (186 ) (1,119 ) (568 ) Extensions and discoveries (including improved recovery) of oil and gas reserves, less related costs 1,591 2,129 1,282 Revisions of previous oil and gas reserve estimates (281 ) (630 ) 644 Net purchases (sales) of minerals in place, before income taxes — (83 ) 116 Accretion of discount 1,635 929 603 Net change in income taxes 1,305 (2,662 ) (709 ) Revision in rate or timing of future production and other changes 12 (124 ) (830 ) Total (2,265 ) 4,294 2,331 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at December 31 $ 8,385 $ 10,650 $ 6,356 98 HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED) Following are selected quarterly results of operations (unaudited): 2019 FirstQuarter SecondQuarter ThirdQuarter FourthQuarter (In millions, except per share amounts) Sales and other operating revenues $ 1,572 $ 1,660 $ 1,580 $ 1,683 Gross profit (loss) (a) $ 361 $ 358 $ 245 $ 252 Net income (loss) 75 34 (166 ) (183 ) Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 43 40 46 39 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation 32 (6 ) (212 ) (222 ) Less: Preferred stock dividends 4 — — — Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation common stockholders $ 28 $ (6 ) (b) (212 ) (c) (222 ) (d) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation per common share: Basic $ 0.09 $ (0.02 ) $ (0.70 ) $ (0.73 ) Diluted $ 0.09 $ (0.02 ) $ (0.70 ) $ (0.73 ) 2018 FirstQuarter SecondQuarter ThirdQuarter FourthQuarter (In millions, except per share amounts) Sales and other operating revenues $ 1,346 $ 1,534 $ 1,793 $ 1,650 Gross profit (loss) (a) $ 244 $ 310 $ 500 $ 310 Net income (loss) (65 ) (87 ) 3 34 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 41 43 45 38 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation (106 ) (130 ) (42 ) (4 ) Less: Preferred stock dividends 11 12 11 12 Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation common stockholders $ (117 ) (e) $ (142 ) (f) $ (53 ) (g) $ (16 ) (h) Net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation per common share: Basic $ (0.38 ) $ (0.48 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.05 ) Diluted $ (0.38 ) $ (0.48 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.05 ) (a) Gross profit represents Sales and other operating revenues, less Marketing expenses, Operating costs and expenses, Production and severance taxes, and Depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Based upon their evaluation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2019, John B. Hess, Chief Executive Officer, and John P. Rielly, Chief Financial Officer, concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019. There was no change in internal controls over financial reporting identified in the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report on the Corporation’s internal controls over financial reporting are included in",2023-12-30 22:19:42.886963
4447,HES,HESS CORP,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Catastrophic and other events, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may materially affect our operations and financial condition. Our oil and gas operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry, including catastrophic events, which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations, result in personal injury and have other significant adverse effects. These events include unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations, equipment malfunctions or failures, derailments, fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, hurricanes, severe weather, geological events, shortages in availability of skilled labor, cyber-attacks or health measures related to COVID-19. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem 20prudent, including for property and casualty losses. There can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable.Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. As part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory or other government agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions, equipment failures, and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows.An inability to secure personnel, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and other required services or to retain key employees may result in material negative economic consequences. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost, including as a result of changes to our industry due to COVID-19, which may impact our ability to run our operations and deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. In addition, difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. Our future success also depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy. An inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations or the loss or departure of key members of senior management may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business.Disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the Corporation or our business partners may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are an integral part of our exploration, development and production activities and the activities of our business partners. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our corporation and with outside business partners. Our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of remote communications and other work-from-home practices in response to COVID-19. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems or those of our business partners and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, any such disruption, failure or cyber breach and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, financial loss, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.Financial RisksWe have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involve substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Although currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Environmental concerns and other factors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices and may increase our costs to access the equity capital markets. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy.21We engage in risk management transactions designed to mitigate commodity price volatility and other risks that may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons, we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility.The alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs. Certain borrowings on our credit facilities and term loan may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be discontinued after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has proposed SOFR as an alternative to LIBOR. At this time, the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include fluctuations in interest rates or an increase in the cost of our credit facility borrowings.Regulatory, Legal and Environmental RisksOur oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages and other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations, solvency of subsequent owners and partners and other uncertainties.Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost.Climate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change and sustainability has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions. These agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of GHGs from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of GHGs. As a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels, demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced, which may have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent GHG emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business. Shareholder activism has been recently increasing in our industry, and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. In addition, certain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change, which could make it more difficult to finance our business. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities, require us to incur increased costs, and/or result in reputational harm.We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Political or regulatory developments and governmental actions, including federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and those of our counterparties with whom we have contracted, which may affect our financial results. These requirements relate to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and 22deductions, including post-production deductions from royalty payments; limitations or prohibitions on the sales of new and extensions on existing oil and gas leases; expropriation or nationalization of property; mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights; imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds; changes in import and export regulations; the imposition of tariffs; and anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. In recent years, proposals for limitations on access to oil and gas exploration and development opportunities and related litigation have grown in certain areas and may include efforts to reduce access to public and private lands; restriction of exploration and production activities within government-owned and other lands; delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction; restrictions or changes to existing pipeline easements; limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal; imposition of set-backs on oil and gas sites; reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel; delaying or denying air-quality or siting permits; advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity; and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm. Costs associated with responding to these anti-development efforts or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, if a temporary or permanent shutdown of the DAPL occurs as a result of the on-going litigation related to use of its easement to cross under the Missouri River, we will need to use alternative means to transport approximately 55,000 bopd of crude oil production in the Bakken, which may increase Bakken price differentials because it would require the use of additional rail cars and personnel to move any displaced DAPL barrels. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political instability and civil unrest in North Africa, South America and the Middle East has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. In addition, geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas, such as the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over a portion of the Stabroek Block. Political instability exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals, enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general.One of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, Hess Midstream LP. The responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities. Our control of Hess Midstream LP bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission. These heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our shareholders. Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.23Item 3. Legal ProceedingsWe are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages.We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are three remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Rhode Island is proceeding in federal court. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit, filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants.In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and agreed with the EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages.In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. The remedy selected by the EPA includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. The EPA’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA’s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us, and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design.From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. Beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. These proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Beginning in 2013, various 24parishes in Louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies, including us, alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, the payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. The ultimate impact of the aforementioned proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates.We are also involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings from time to time in addition to the matters described above, including claims related to post-production deductions from royalty payments. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding.Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.Item 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A.The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations omits certain discussions of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019, which can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2020, and such comparisons are incorporated herein by reference.IndexOverviewConsolidated Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOverviewHess Corporation is a global E&P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), Malaysia, and Denmark. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we have announced eighteen significant discoveries. The Liza Phase 1 development achieved first production in December 2019, and reached its nameplate production capacity of approximately 120,000 gross bopd in December 2020. The Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned in the second quarter of 2019 and is expected to achieve first production by early 2022, with production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd. A third development, Payara, was sanctioned in the third quarter of 2020 and is expected to achieve first production in 2024, with production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd. The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin up to ten FPSOs with the first five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2026.Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2020, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota.Hess Response to COVID-19 and Market ConditionsCOVID-19 continues to have a profound impact on society and industry. The Corporation’s first priority in the midst of the pandemic has been the health and safety of the Hess workforce and local communities where the Corporation operates. A multidisciplinary Hess emergency response team has been overseeing plans and precautions to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in the work environment while maintaining business continuity based on the most current recommendations by government and public health agencies. The Corporation has implemented a variety of health and safety measures including enhanced cleaning procedures and modified work practices such as travel restrictions, health screenings, reduced personnel at offshore platforms and onshore work sites wherever this can be done safely, and remote working arrangements for office workers. In July 2020, Hess Midstream LP announced that the planned maintenance turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant originally scheduled for the third quarter of 2020 will be deferred until 2021 to ensure safe execution in light of COVID-19.In addition to the global health concerns of COVID-19, the pandemic has severely impacted demand for oil. Our realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were $44.28 per barrel in 2020 (2019: $56.77; 2018: $60.77). In response to the resulting sharp decline in oil prices, the Corporation’s focus is on preserving cash and capability, while protecting the long-term value of its assets. In the first quarter of 2020, we reduced our E&P capital and exploratory budget of $3.0 billion for 2020 to $1.9 billion, and we ended the year with actual capital and exploratory expenditures of $1.8 billion. This reduction was achieved primarily by shifting from a six rig program to one rig in the Bakken, which was accomplished in May, deferral of some 2020 development activities on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, and deferring discretionary spending across the portfolio. In March 2020, Hess entered into a $1.0 billion three year term loan agreement, and in November, we sold our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field for net proceeds of $482 million, after closing adjustments.292021 OutlookOur E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are projected to be approximately $1.9 billion in 2021. Capital investment for our Midstream operations is expected to be approximately $160 million. Oil and gas net production in 2021 is forecast to be approximately 310,000 boepd excluding Libya. For 2021, we have WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel for 120,000 bopd, and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 30,000 bopd.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,333 million in 2020, compared with $1,642 million in 2019, while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1,803 million in 2020 and $2,237 million in 2019. Capital expenditures for 2020 and 2019 were $1,931 million and $2,992 million, respectively. In 2021, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities, proceeds from the first quarter 2021 sale of 4.2 million barrels of crude oil stored on two VLCCs at year-end, and cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2020 of $1.74 billion will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends. Due to the volatile commodity price environment, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays, including dividends, pursue asset sales, borrow against our committed revolving credit facility, or issue debt or equity securities.Consolidated ResultsNet loss attributable to Hess Corporation was $3,093 million in 2020 (2019: $408 million). Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 33, the adjusted net loss was $894 million in 2020 (2019: $281 million). Annual net production averaged 331,000 boepd in 2020 (2019: 311,000 boepd). Total proved reserves were 1,170 million boe at December 31, 2020 (2019: 1,197 million boe).Significant 2020 ActivitiesThe following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2020:E&P assets:•In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken shale play averaged 193,000 boepd in 2020 (2019: 152,000 boepd), with net oil production up 15% to 107,000 bopd from 93,000 bopd primarily due to increased wells online and improved well performance. Natural gas and NGL production also increased from higher wells online, additional natural gas captured and processed, and approximately 7,000 boepd of additional volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts resulting from lower prices. During the year, we operated six rigs in the Bakken through May, before reducing to one rig for the remainder of 2020 in response to the sharp decline in oil prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We drilled 71 wells and brought 111 wells on production, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,686 by year-end. We reduced the average cost of a plug and perf well in 2020 to $6.2 million per well from $6.8 million per well in 2019. We forecast net production from the Bakken to average approximately 170,000 boepd in 2021.In the second quarter, we chartered three VLCCs and loaded a total of 6.3 million barrels of oil for sale in Asian markets to enhance cash flow and maximize value from our Bakken production. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in China in September. We have agreements in place to sell the remaining two VLCC cargos totaling 4.2 million barrels in the first quarter of 2021. We expect to recognize net income of approximately $60 million in the first quarter of 2021 from these sales, including associated hedging gains and costs.•In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 56,000 boepd (2019: 66,000 boepd) reflecting the effect of increased hurricane-related downtime, higher planned maintenance and lower production from the Shenzi Field, which was sold in November 2020, partially offset by initial production from the Esox-1 well, which commenced in February of 2020. Net production from the Shenzi Field was 9,000 boepd in 2020 (2019: 12,000 boepd). We forecast Gulf of Mexico net production for 2021 to average approximately 45,000 boepd.We participated in two outside operated exploration wells that were completed in 2020, the Oldfield-1 well and the Galapagos Deep well, both located in the Mississippi Canyon area. Both wells were unsuccessful.•At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, net production from the Liza Phase 1 development averaged 20,000 bopd in 2020 following first production in December 2019 from the Liza Destiny FPSO. During the fourth quarter, the operator Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, reached its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross bopd. For 2021, net production from Guyana is expected to average approximately 30,000 bopd.The Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned in 2019 and will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected by early 2022. A total of 30 wells are planned at six drill centers, including 15 production wells, nine water injection wells and six gas injection wells. In 2021, the operator plans to continue development 30drilling, complete installation of subsea flow lines and equipment, complete installation of topside facilities on the FPSO and sail the Liza Unity FPSO from Singapore to the Liza Field.On September 30, 2020, we announced the final investment decision to proceed with development of the Payara Field on the Stabroek Block after the development plan received approval from the government of Guyana. Payara will utilize the Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected in 2024. Ten drill centers with a total of 41 wells are planned, including 20 production wells and 21 injection wells. Excluding pre-sanction costs and FPSO purchase cost, our net share of development costs is forecast to be approximately $1.8 billion.In addition to the first three developments, planning is underway for additional FPSOs. The ultimate sizing and timing of these potential developments will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling.In 2020, two successful exploration wells and one successful appraisal well were drilled on the Stabroek Block. For 2021, the operator plans to bring in a fifth drillship in March and a sixth drillship in April and drill 12 to 15 exploration and appraisal wells during the year.•At the Kaieteur Block (Hess 15%), offshore Guyana, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, completed drilling of the Tanager-1 exploration well. The well did encounter hydrocarbons but was not a commercial success on a stand-alone basis.•In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A‑18 of the JDA averaged 29,000 boepd for the year (2019: 35,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, while net production from North Malay Basin averaged 23,000 boepd for the year (2019: 28,000 boepd). During 2020, we drilled seven production wells at North Malay Basin, and plan to continue the drilling program and development activities in 2021. We also expect to commence a multi-year drilling program in the first half of 2021 at the JDA. Combined net production from our JDA and North Malay Basin assets is forecast to average approximately 60,000 boepd in 2021.The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2020:•In 2019, Hess Midstream LP announced plans to expand processing capacity at the Tioga Gas Plant by 150 mmcfd for total processing capacity of 400 mmcfd. In 2020, the facility construction was completed for the expansion. The incremental gas processing capacity is expected to be available in 2021 upon completion of a scheduled plant maintenance turnaround, during which the expansion and residue and NGL takeaway pipelines will be tied in. The plant maintenance turnaround was originally planned to occur in the third quarter of 2020 but was deferred to 2021 to ensure safe execution in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.•On December 30, 2020, Hess Midstream LP exercised its renewal options to extend the terms of certain gas gathering, crude oil gathering, gas processing and fractionation, storage, and terminal and export commercial agreements for the secondary term through December 31, 2033. There were no changes to any provisions of the existing commercial agreements as a result of the exercise of the renewal options.31Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory ExpendituresIn 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,333 million (2019: $1,642 million). At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $1,739 million (2019: $1,545 million), consolidated debt was $8,296 million (2019: $7,142 million), and our debt to capitalization ratio (as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement) was 47.5% (2019: 39.6%). Hess Midstream debt, which is nonrecourse to Hess Corporation, was $1,910 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: $1,753 million).Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions): 202020192018E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures: United States North Dakota$661 $1,312 $967 Offshore and other258 471 411 Total United States919 1,783 1,378 Guyana743 783 383 Malaysia and JDA99 109 123 Other (a)25 68 185 E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures$1,786 $2,743 $2,069 Exploration Expenses Charged to Income Included Above: United States$91 $105 $106 International17 62 54 Total Exploration Expenses Charged to Income included above$108 $167 $160 Midstream Capital Expenditures: Midstream Capital Expenditures (b)$253 $416 $271 (a)Other includes our interests in Denmark, Libya and other non-producing countries.(b)Excludes equity investments of $33 million in 2019 and $67 million in 2018.In 2021, we project our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $1.9 billion and Midstream capital expenditures to be approximately $160 million.Consolidated Results of OperationsResults by Segment:The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 202020192018 (In millions, except per share amounts)Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation: Exploration and Production$(2,841)$53 $51 Midstream230 144 120 Corporate, Interest and Other(482)(605)(453)Total$(3,093)$(408)$(282)Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Per Common Share - Diluted (a)$(10.15)$(1.37)$(1.10)(a)Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation less preferred stock dividends, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares.In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.32Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods:The following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods.

Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations.Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and 33liabilities to evaluate the Corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods.These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.Comparison of ResultsExploration and ProductionFollowing is a summarized statement of income for our E&P operations: 202020192018 (In millions)Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues$4,667 $6,495 $6,323 Gains on asset sales, net79 22 27 Other, net31 51 53 Total revenues and non-operating income4,777 6,568 6,403 Costs and Expenses Marketing, including purchased oil and gas1,067 1,849 1,833 Operating costs and expenses895 971 941 Production and severance taxes124 184 171 Midstream tariffs946 722 648 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment351 233 362 General and administrative expenses206 204 258 Depreciation, depletion and amortization1,915 1,977 1,748 Impairment2,126 — — Total costs and expenses7,630 6,140 5,961 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes(2,853)428 442 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (a)(12)375 391 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$(2,841)$53 $51 (a)Commencing January 1, 2019, management changed its measurement of segment earnings to reflect income taxes on a post U.S. tax consolidation and valuation allowance assessment basis. See footnote (a) in the table on page 87 for further details.Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 38, the changes in E&P results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, Midstream tariffs, DD&A, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below.34Selling Prices: Average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 22% lower in 2020 compared with the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for NGL decreased in 2020 by 16% and worldwide natural gas prices decreased in 2020 by 24%, compared with the prior year. In total, lower realized selling prices decreased financial results by approximately $780 million after income taxes, compared with 2019. Our average selling prices were as follows: 202020192018Average Selling Prices (a)Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Including Hedging) United States North Dakota$42.63 $53.19 $56.90 Offshore45.92 59.18 62.02 Total United States43.56 55.15 58.69 Guyana46.41 — — Malaysia and JDA37.91 61.81 70.42 Other (b)51.37 65.22 69.76 Worldwide44.28 56.77 60.77 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Excluding Hedging) United States North Dakota$33.87 $53.18 $60.64 Offshore36.55 59.17 65.73 Total United States34.63 55.14 62.41 Guyana37.40 — — Malaysia and JDA37.91 61.81 70.42 Other (b)43.42 65.22 69.76 Worldwide35.52 56.76 63.80 Natural Gas Liquids - Per Barrel United States North Dakota$11.29 $13.20 $21.48 Other Onshore (c)— — 18.55 Offshore8.94 13.31 25.58 Worldwide11.10 13.21 21.81 Natural Gas - Per Mcf United States North Dakota$1.27 $1.59 $2.42 Other Onshore (c)— — 2.02 Offshore1.23 2.12 2.68 Total United States1.26 1.83 2.43 Malaysia and JDA4.47 5.04 5.07 Other (b)3.41 4.63 4.41 Worldwide2.98 3.90 4.18 (a)Selling prices in the United States are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in Marketing expenses.

For 2021, we have WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel for 120,000 bopd, and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 30,000 bopd. We expect put option premium amortization, which will be reflected in realized selling prices, to reduce our 2021 results by approximately $205 million.35Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 202020192018 (In thousands)Crude Oil - Barrels United States North Dakota107 94 77 Offshore (a)38 46 41 Total United States145 140 118 Guyana20 — — Malaysia and JDA4 4 4 Other (b)9 25 24 Total178 169 146 Natural Gas Liquids - Barrels United States North Dakota56 42 31 Other Onshore (c)— — 3 Total Onshore56 42 34 Offshore (a)5 5 5 Total United States61 47 39 Natural Gas - Mcf United States North Dakota180 110 76 Other Onshore (c)— — 38 Total Onshore180 110 114 Offshore (a)76 91 67 Total United States256 201 181 Malaysia and JDA291 351 352 Other (b)7 20 20 Total554 572 553 Barrels of Oil Equivalent331 311 277 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production72 %69 %67 %(a)In November 2020, we sold our working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production from the Shenzi Field was 9,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019: 12,000 boepd; 2018: 16,000 boepd).(b)Other includes our interests in Denmark and Libya. Net production from Libya was 4,000 boepd for 2020 (2019: 21,000 boepd; 2018: 20,000 boepd). Net production from Denmark was 6,000 boepd for 2020 (2019: 7,000 boepd; 2018: 7,000 boepd). (c)In August 2018, we sold our interests in the Utica shale play, onshore U.S. Production was 9,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2018.In 2021, we expect net production, excluding Libya, to be approximately 310,000 boepd, compared with 2020 net production, excluding Libya and assets sold, of 318,000 boepd.Net production variances related to 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:United States: North Dakota net oil production was higher in 2020, primarily due to increased wells online and improved well performance. North Dakota net natural gas and NGL production was higher in 2020, due to increased wells online and improved well performance, additional natural gas captured and processed, and additional volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts resulting from lower prices. Offshore net production was down in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the effect of increased hurricane-related downtime and higher planned maintenance in 2020 and lower production from the Shenzi Field, which was sold in November 2020, partially offset by initial production from the Esox-1 well, which commenced in February of 2020.International: Net crude oil production from Guyana was higher in 2020, due to the start-up of the Liza Phase 1 development in December 2019, while net crude oil production in Libya was largely shut in during 2020 due to force majeure caused by civil unrest. Net natural gas production was lower from Malaysia and JDA due to COVID-19 impacts on economic activity in Malaysia and Thailand which reduced natural gas nominations from the buyers.36Sales Volumes: Higher sales volumes from our net production in 2020 improved after-tax results by approximately $130 million, compared with 2019. Net worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, which excludes sales volumes of crude oil, NGL and natural gas purchased from third parties, were as follows: 202020192018 (In thousands)Crude oil – barrels (a)60,924 61,061 52,742 Natural gas liquids – barrels22,397 17,067 14,019 Natural gas – mcf202,917 208,665 202,041 Barrels of Oil Equivalent117,141 112,906 100,435 Crude oil - barrels per day167 167 144 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day61 47 39 Natural gas - mcf per day554 572 553 Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day320 309 275 (a)In 2020, 6.3 million barrels of Bakken crude oil were loaded on VLCCs for sale in Asian markets. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold during the third quarter of 2020 and the remaining two VLCC cargos totaling 4.2 million barrels have been sold for delivery in the first quarter of 2021.Marketing, including purchased oil and gas (Marketing expense): Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, primarily in the U.S., and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. marketing activities. Marketing expense was lower in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower crude oil prices paid for purchased volumes from third parties.Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs consist of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses. Excluding items affecting comparability described in Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below, cash operating costs decreased $159 million, or 12%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily from the impact of cost reduction initiatives and lower production and severance taxes associated with lower crude oil prices. On a per-unit basis, cash operating costs improved 17% from 2019 reflecting lower costs and the impact of higher production volumes.Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense increased from 2019, primarily due to higher throughput volumes and tariff rates in 2020. In 2021, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $1,090 million to $1,115 million.DD&A: DD&A expenses decreased by $62 million from 2019, primarily due to a lower portfolio average DD&A rate, due in part to impairment charges in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by higher production volumes. DD&A expense on a per-unit basis was lower in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the year-over-year mix of production and the impact of reduced DD&A rates for assets impaired in the first quarter of 2020.Unit costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P net production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: ActualForecast range (a) 2020201920182021Cash operating costs (b)$9.91 $11.99 $12.66 $10.50 — $11.50DD&A (c)15.80 17.43 17.14 12.00 — 13.00Total Production Unit Costs$25.71 $29.42 $29.80 $22.50 — $24.50(a)Forecast information excludes any contribution from Libya.(b)Cash operating costs per boe, excluding Libya, was $9.85 in 2020 (2019: $12.54; 2018: $13.32). (c)DD&A per boe, excluding Libya, was $15.98 in 2020 (2019: $18.52; 2018: $18.29).37Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows: 202020192018 (In millions)Exploratory dry hole costs (a)$192 $49 $165 Exploration lease and other impairment (b)51 17 37 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead108 167 160 $351 $233 $362 (a)In 2020, dry hole costs primarily related to the Tanager-1 well in the Kaieteur Block, offshore Guyana, the Galapagos Deep and Oldfield-1 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and the write-off of previously capitalized exploratory wells (see Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below). In 2019, dry hole costs primarily related to the Jill-1 well on License 6/16 in Denmark and the Oldfield-1 well in the Gulf of Mexico. Dry hole expense for the Oldfield-1 well was $15 million in 2019 and $12 million in 2020.(b)In 2020, exploration lease and other impairment included impaired leasehold costs due to a reprioritization of the Corporation’s forward capital program (see Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below).In 2021, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.Income Taxes: In 2020, income tax benefit was $12 million compared with expense of $375 million in 2019, primarily due to reduced activity in Libya resulting from force majeure on operations for the majority of the year. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark, and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. The valuation allowance established against the net deferred tax asset in Guyana for the Stabroek Block was released as a result of the positive evidence from first production in December 2019, and the significant forecasted pre-tax income from operations. The cumulative pre-tax losses in Guyana were driven by pre-production activities. See E&P Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below.Actual effective tax rates are as follows: 202020192018 %%%Effective income tax benefit (expense) rate0(88)(88)Adjusted effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (a)(5)(36)60(a)Excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings.In 2021, we estimate income tax expense, excluding Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million.Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense): Before Income TaxesAfter Income Taxes 202020192018202020192018 (In millions)Impairment$(2,126)$— $— $(2,049)$— $— Dry hole and lease impairment expenses(152)— — (150)— — Crude oil inventories write-down(53)— — (52)— — Exit costs and other(26)— (110)(26)— (110)Cost recovery settlement— (21)— — (19)— Reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowance— — — — 60 — Gains on asset sales, net79 22 24 79 22 24 $(2,278)$1 $(86)$(2,198)$63 $(86)38The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income are as follows: Before Income Taxes202020192018 (In millions)Gains on asset sales, net$79 $22 $24 Marketing, including purchased oil and gas(53)(21)— Operating costs and expenses(20)— (19)Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment(153)— (3)General and administrative expenses(5)— (72)Depreciation, depletion and amortization— — (16)Impairment(2,126)— — $(2,278)$1 $(86)2020:•Impairment: We recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $2.1 billion ($2.0 billion after income taxes) related to our oil and gas properties at North Malay Basin in Malaysia, the South Arne Field in Denmark, and the Stampede and Tubular Bells fields in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. Other charges totaling $21 million pre-tax ($20 million after income taxes) related to drilling rig right-of-use assets in the Bakken and surplus materials and supplies. See Note 12, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Dry hole and lease impairment expenses: We incurred pre-tax charges totaling $152 million ($150 million after income taxes) in the first quarter to write-off previously capitalized exploratory well costs of $125 million ($123 million after income taxes) primarily related to the northern portion of the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico and to impair certain exploration leasehold costs by $27 million ($27 million after income taxes) due to a reprioritization of our capital program.•Crude oil inventories write-down: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $53 million ($52 million after income taxes) to adjust crude oil inventories to their net realizable value at the end of the first quarter following the significant decline in crude oil prices.•Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $26 million ($26 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits incurred related to cost reduction initiatives.•Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $79 million ($79 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.2019:•Cost recovery settlement: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $21 million ($19 million after income taxes) related to a settlement on historical cost recovery balances in the JDA that was paid in cash.•Reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowance: We recorded a noncash income tax benefit of $60 million, which resulted from the reversal of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in Guyana upon achieving first production from the Liza Phase 1 development.•Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our remaining acreage in the Utica shale play.2018:•Exit costs and other: We incurred noncash pre-tax charges of $73 million ($73 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $37 million ($37 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits related to a cost reduction program undertaken to reflect the reduced scale of our business following significant asset sales in 2017.•Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($14 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio and a pre-tax gain of $10 million ($10 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in Ghana.39MidstreamFollowing is a summarized statement of income for our Midstream operations: 202020192018 (In millions)Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues$1,092 $848 $713 Other, net10 4 6 Total revenues and non-operating income1,102 852 719 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses338 279 193 General and administrative expenses21 56 14 Depreciation, depletion and amortization157 142 127 Interest expense95 63 60 Total costs and expenses611 540 394 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes491 312 325 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (a)7 — 38 Net income (loss)484 312 287 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests254 168 167 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$230 $144 $120 (a)Commencing January 1, 2019, management changed its measurement of segment earnings to reflect income taxes on a post U.S. tax consolidation and valuation allowance assessment basis. See footnote (a) in the table on page 87 for further details.Sales and other operating revenues increased from 2019 primarily due to higher throughput volumes and tariff rates. Operating costs and expenses increased from 2019 primarily due to increased operating and maintenance expenditures on expanded infrastructure and initial costs incurred related to the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround planned for 2021. General and administrative expenses decreased from 2019 as a result of expenditures incurred from Hess Midstream LP’s acquisition of HIP and its corporate restructuring. See Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings below. DD&A expenses increased from 2019 primarily due to additional assets placed in service. The increase in interest expense from 2019 reflects higher borrowings by the Midstream business.In 2021, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $280 million to $290 million.Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: In 2019, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($16 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interests) in General and Administrative Expenses for transaction related costs for Hess Midstream Partners LP’s acquisition of HIP and the associated corporate restructuring. See Note 4, Hess Midstream LP in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate, Interest and OtherThe following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 202020192018 (In millions)Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability)$114 $114 $97 Interest expense373 355 359 Less: Capitalized interest— (38)(20)Interest expense, net373 317 339 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes487 431 436 Provision (benefit) for income taxes(6)— (3)Net Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes481 431 433 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after income taxes1 174 20 Total Corporate, Interest and Other Expenses After Income Taxes$482 $605 $453 Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were comparable in 2020 compared to the corresponding period in 2019. In 2021, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million.Interest expense, net was higher in 2020 due to interest incurred on the $1.0 billion three year term loan entered into in March 2020 and lower capitalized interest. In 2021, after-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $380 million to $390 million.40Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense):2020:•Exit costs and other: We included a pre-tax charge of $1 million ($1 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits related to cost reduction initiatives.2019:•Pension settlement: We recorded a noncash pension settlement charge of $88 million ($88 million after income taxes) associated with the purchase of a single premium annuity contract by the Hess Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan to settle and transfer certain of its obligations to a third party. The charge is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.•Income tax: We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax expense of $86 million that was previously a component of accumulated other comprehensive income related to our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts.2018:•Loss on debt extinguishment: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $53 million ($53 million after income taxes) related to the premium paid for debt repurchases.•Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $58 million ($58 million after income taxes) resulting from the settlement of legal claims related to former downstream interests.•Income tax: We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax benefit of $91 million to offset the recognition of a noncash income tax expense recorded in other comprehensive income resulting primarily from changes in fair value of our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 20202019 (In millions, except ratio)Cash and cash equivalents (a)$1,739 $1,545 Current maturities of long-term debt10 — Total debt (b)8,296 7,142 Total equity6,335 9,706 Debt to capitalization ratio for debt covenants (c)47.5 %39.6 %(a)Includes $4 million of cash attributable to our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2020 (2019: $3 million).(b)Includes $1,910 million of debt outstanding from our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2020 (2019: $1,753 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation.(c)Total Consolidated Debt of Hess Corporation (including finance leases and excluding Midstream non-recourse debt) as a percentage of Total Capitalization of Hess Corporation as defined under Hess Corporation's term loan and revolving credit facility financial covenants. Total Capitalization excludes the impact of noncash impairment charges and non-controlling interests. See Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash FlowsThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 202020192018 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$1,333 $1,642 $1,939 Investing activities(1,707)(2,843)(1,566)Financing activities568 52 (2,526)Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents$194 $(1,149)$(2,153)Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,333 million in 2020 (2019: $1,642 million), while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1,803 million in 2020 (2019: $2,237 million). Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased from 2019 primarily due to lower realized selling prices. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by $470 million, primarily from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, an increase in crude oil inventory resulting from our VLCC transactions, and abandonment expenditures, partially offset by lower receivables. Changes in operating 41assets and liabilities in 2019 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by $595 million primarily related to premiums on crude oil hedge contracts, abandonment expenditures, pension contributions and an increase in accounts receivable.Investing Activities: Total Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment were $2,197 million in 2020 (2019: $2,829 million). The decrease primarily reflects lower drilling activity in the Bakken, partially offset by payments in the first quarter of 2020 to settle capital expenditures accrued in the fourth quarter of 2019. In 2019, Midstream equity investments in its 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources were $33 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $493 million in 2020 (2019: $22 million).Financing Activities: Borrowings in 2020 related to our $1.0 billion three year term loan while borrowings in 2019 related to our Midstream operating segment. Repayments of debt were $8 million in 2019. Net borrowings (repayments) of debt with maturities of 90 days or less related to our Midstream operating segment revolving credit facilities. Common stock dividends paid were $309 million in 2020 compared to common and preferred dividends of $316 million in 2019. Net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were $261 million in 2020 (2019: $353 million).Future Capital Requirements and ResourcesAt December 31, 2020, Hess Corporation, had $1.74 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $5.4 billion. Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion committed revolving credit facility matures in May 2023, and we have no debt maturities until 2023 when the three year term loan matures.Net production in 2021 is forecast to be approximately 310,000 boepd, excluding Libya, and we expect our 2021 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $1.9 billion. For 2021, we have WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel for 120,000 bopd, and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 30,000 bopd.In 2021, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities, proceeds from the first quarter 2021 sale of 4.2 million barrels of crude oil stored on two VLCCs at year-end, and cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2020 of $1.74 billion, will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends. Due to the volatile commodity price environment, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays, including dividends, pursue asset sales, borrow against our committed revolving credit facility, or issue debt or equity securities.The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2020:ExpirationDateCapacityBorrowingsLetters ofCreditIssuedTotalUsedAvailableCapacity (In millions)Hess Corporation Revolving credit facilityMay 2023$3,500 $— $— $— $3,500 Committed linesVarious (a)175 — 54 54 121 Uncommitted linesVarious (a)215 — 215 215 — Total - Hess Corporation $3,890 $— $269 $269 $3,621 Midstream Revolving credit facility (b)December 2024$1,000 $184 $— $184 $816 Total - Midstream $1,000 $184 $— $184 $816 (a)Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2021.(b)This credit facility may only be utilized by HESM Opco and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation.Hess Corporation:In 2020, we entered into a $1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of March 16, 2023. Borrowings under the term loan generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 2.25% until the term loan's first anniversary. The applicable margin varies based on the credit rating of the Corporation’s senior unsecured long-term debt and will increase by 0.25% on each anniversary of the term loan.In 2019, we entered into a new $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 15, 2023, which replaced the Corporation’s previous revolving credit facility. The new facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings will generally bear interest at 1.30% above LIBOR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. At December 31, 2020, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility.The revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of 42the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15% (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement). The indentures for the Corporation's fixed-rate public notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15%. As of December 31, 2020, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants. For additional information regarding the alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR on our borrowing costs, see Financial Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors.The most restrictive of the financial covenants related to our fixed-rate public notes and our term loan and revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional $1,730 million of secured debt at December 31, 2020.We had $269 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2020 (2019: $272 million), which primarily relate to our international operations. We have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.Midstream:At December 31, 2020, Hess Midstream Operations LP (formerly Hess Midstream Partners LP, or HESM Opco), a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, had $1.4 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing December 16, 2024, consisting of a $1.0 billion five year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn $400 million five year term loan A facility. The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund HESM Opco’s operating activities, capital expenditures, distributions and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the five year term loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the five year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. HESM Opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2020. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all the presently owned and after-acquired assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2020, borrowings of $184 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s term loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation.Credit RatingsTwo of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed our credit rating at BBB- with negative outlook in October 2020 while Fitch Ratings affirmed a BBB- credit rating and stable outlook in August 2020. Moody’s Investors Service affirmed our credit rating at Ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade, in March 2020.At December 31, 2020, HESM Opco’s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, and Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service.43Contractual Obligations and ContingenciesThe following table sets forth aggregate information about certain of the Corporation's consolidated contractual obligations at December 31, 2020: Payments Due by PeriodTotal20212022 and20232024 and2025Thereafter (In millions)Total Debt (excluding deferred financing costs, discounts, and interest) (a)$8,372 $10 $1,050 $824 $6,488 Finance Leases (b)356 367272176Operating Leases (b)663 83155138287Purchase Obligations: Capital expenditures (b)2,837 8681,469 500— Operating expenses (b)236 1676351Transportation and related contracts (b)2,867 3107564931,308Asset retirement obligations2,116 105170861,755 Other liabilities583 799575334(a)We anticipate cash payments for interest on Total Debt of $440 million for 2021, $850 million for 2022-2023, $784 million for 2024-2025, and $3,231 million thereafter for a total of $5,305 million. These interest payments reflect our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020.(b)Comprises obligations, including where we, as operator, have contracted directly with suppliers.Capital expenditures represent amounts for which we were contractually committed at December 31, 2020, and include a portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2021. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020, including post-retirement plan liabilities for our unfunded plans and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries primarily lease drilling rigs, equipment, logistical assets (offshore vessels, aircraft, and shorebases), and office space for varying periods. See Note 6, Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt December 31, 2020, we had $269 million in letters of credit. See also Note 18, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Foreign OperationsWe conduct E&P activities outside the U.S., principally in Guyana, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand, Malaysia, Denmark, Libya, Suriname, and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, currency risk, corruption and acts of terrorism. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesAccounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.44Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E&P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets.For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year.Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2021 are at levels below that used in determining 2020 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2021 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2021 above those used in determining 2020 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2021, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2021 crude oil prices, the amount of any additions to proved reserves, positive or negative revisions in proved reserves related to 2021 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2021 crude oil prices, and management’s plans as of December 31, 2021 for developing proved undeveloped reserves. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2020 would result in an approximate $150 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2021 based on projected production volumes. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 91 through 99 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves.Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements.In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.Our impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the economic slowdown from the COVID-19 pandemic, we reviewed our oil and gas fields and midstream operating segment asset groups for impairment at March 31, 2020. We impaired various oil and gas fields located in Malaysia, Denmark, and the Gulf of Mexico in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. See Note 12, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. We could experience an impairment in the future if one or a combination of the following occur: the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline below the long-term crude oil price outlook used in the March 31, 2020 impairment test, or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.Hess Midstream LP: We consolidate the activities of our interest in Hess Midstream LP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. This 45conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered Hess Midstream LP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between Hess Midstream LP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of Hess Midstream LP.Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. Due to a sustained low commodity price environment, we remained in a three-year cumulative consolidated loss position at December 31, 2020. A three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark, and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. In December 2019, we reversed the valuation allowance of $60 million for Guyana upon achieving first production from the Liza Phase 1 development.At December 31, 2020, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $5,391 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth. Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E&P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations.Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. The most significant assumptions relate to:Discount rates used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost: The discount rates used to estimate our projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. At December 31, 2020, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate assumptions would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately $145 million and would decrease forecasted 2021 annual net periodic benefit income by approximately $10 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligations 46would decrease the funded status of our pension plans, but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios.Expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets: The expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of plan assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. At December 31, 2020, a 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption would decrease forecasted 2021 annual net periodic benefit income by approximately $10 million.Other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and expected participant mortality.Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities.We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.Environment, Health and SafetyOur long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our EHS & SR policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives.Environmental MattersWe recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. The EPA has adopted a series of GHG monitoring, reporting, and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting further legislation to reduce GHG emissions. In addition, states have taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. At the international level, the Paris Agreement on climate change aimed to enhance global response to global temperature changes and to reduce GHG emissions, among other things. We are committed to complying with all GHG emissions regulations that apply to our operations, including those related to venting or flaring of natural gas, and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. While we monitor climate-related regulatory initiatives and international public policy issues, the current state of ongoing international climate initiatives and any related domestic 47actions make it difficult to assess the timing or effect on our operations or to predict with certainty the future costs that we may incur in order to comply with future international treaties, legislation or new regulations. However, future restrictions on emissions of GHGs, or related measures to encourage use of low carbon energy could result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products, as described under Regulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include E&P facilities, sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and, although not currently significant, EPA “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. For additional information, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. At December 31, 2020, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $65 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $15 million in 2020 (2019: $20 million; 2018: $15 million). The amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.Health and Safety MattersThe crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels regarding the health and safety of E&P operations. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other matters, occupational safety, the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production, well control and integrity, process safety and equipment integrity, and may include permitting and disclosure requirements, operating restrictions and other conditions on the development of crude oil and natural gas. The level of our expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country health and safety regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. While compliance with laws and regulations relating to health and safety matters increases the overall cost of business for us and the oil and gas industry in general, it has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or results of operations. Occupational Safety: We are subject to the requirements set forth under federal workplace standards by the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. Under OSHA and other federal and state occupational safety and health laws and laws of foreign countries in which we operate, we must develop, maintain and disclose certain information about hazardous materials used, released, or produced in our operations. Production and Well Integrity: Our U.S. onshore production facilities are subject to U.S. federal government, state and local regulations regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing and well control and integrity. Our offshore production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico are subject to the U.S. federal government’s Safety and Environmental Management System regulations, which provide a systematic approach for identifying, managing and mitigating hazards. Adapting to new technical standards and procedures in production and in our well integrity management system is fundamental to our aim of protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce and the communities in which we operate, and to safeguarding our product.Process Safety and Equipment Integrity: We are also regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels regarding process safety and the integrity of our equipment, including OSHA’s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard. ICE are barriers and safeguards that prevent or mitigate process safety incidents through detection, isolation, containment, control or emergency preparedness and response within our facilities. We have established ICE performance standards, which set specific requirements and criteria for inspections and tests that help to ensure ICE barriers are effective. We conduct assessments collaboratively with our operated assets, subject matter experts and technical authorities to evaluate compliance with corporate and asset environment, health and safety standards and procedures, as well as with applicable regulations. For additional information on our emergency response and incident mitigation activities, see Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures in Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties. 48Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskIn the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities.Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options in our risk management activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them:•Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract.•Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound, Danish Krone, Canadian Dollar and Malaysian Ringgit, which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of those currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date.•Exchange-traded Contracts: We may use exchange-traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits.•Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange-traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and have the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities.Financial Risk Management ActivitiesWe have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $163 million at December 31, 2020 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain or loss of less than $5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020.At December 31, 2020, our total long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments, had a carrying value of $8,296 million and a fair value of $9,647 million. A 15% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately $400 million or $430 million, respectively. Any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixed-rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity.At December 31, 2020, we had WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of approximately $45 per barrel for 75,000 bopd for 2021. As of December 31, 2020, an assumed 10% increase in the forward WTI crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our WTI put options would reduce the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $20 million, while an assumed 10% decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $30 million. In the first quarter of 2021, we increased the average monthly floor price of 75,000 bopd of WTI put option contracts from approximately $45 per barrel to $50 per barrel for the remainder of 2021. We also purchased additional WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel for 45,000 bopd and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 30,000 bopd. As a result, we now have total purchased WTI put options of 120,000 bopd with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel and total purchased Brent put options of 30,000 bopd with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for the remainder of 2021.We have outstanding Brent crude oil swap contracts associated with the 4.2 million barrels stored on two VLCCs at year-end. As of December 31, 2020, an assumed 10% increase in the forward Brent crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our Brent swaps would reduce the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $20 million, while an assumed 10% decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $20 million.See Note 20, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.49Item 8.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as stated in their report, which is included herein.By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. RiellyExecutive Vice President andChief Financial Officer John B. HessChief Executive OfficerMarch 1, 202151Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and StockholdersHess CorporationOpinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated March 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPNew York, New YorkMarch 1, 202152Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and StockholdersHess CorporationOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and natural gas propertiesDescription of the Matter The net book value of the Corporation’s exploration and production assets was $10,993 million at December 31, 2020, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $1,915 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Corporation follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, DD&A expense is recorded using the units-of-production method, based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by petroleum engineering specialists, for property acquisition costs and proved developed oil and gas reserves, also estimated by petroleum engineering specialists, for oil and gas production facilities and wells. Proved oil and gas reserves are based on geological and engineering evaluations of 53 estimated in-place hydrocarbon volumes using financial and non-financial inputs. Significant judgment is required by the Corporations’ internal engineering staff in evaluating the geological and engineering data used to estimate reserves. Estimating proved reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and natural gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. Management used independent petroleum engineering specialists to audit approximately 92% of the Corporation’s proved reserves at December 31, 2020 as prepared by the Corporation’s internal engineering staff.Auditing the Corporation’s DD&A expense calculation is complex because of our need to assess the reasonableness of management’s determination of the inputs described above used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves and to use the work of the internal engineering staff and independent petroleum engineering specialists.How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the DD&A expense calculation. This included controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves. Our testing of the Corporation’s DD&A expense calculation included, among other procedures, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Corporation’s internal petroleum engineering specialist responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s reserve estimates and of the independent petroleum engineering specialist used to audit the estimates. In addition, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing significant inputs to source documentation, where available, on a sample basis and assessing the inputs for reasonableness based on review of corroborative evidence and consideration of any contrary evidence. For proved undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management’s development plans for compliance with the SEC rule that undrilled locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time, by assessing consistency of the development projection with the Corporation’s drill plan and the availability of capital relative to the drill plan. Additionally, we performed analytic and lookback procedures on inputs into the oil and gas reserve estimate as well as on the outputs. Finally, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the DD&A expense calculations, including comparing the proved oil and gas reserves to the Corporation’s reserve report. Impairment of oil and natural gas propertiesDescription of theMatter The net book value of the Corporation’s exploration and production assets was $10,993 million at December 31, 2020, and impairment expense was $2,105 million for the year then ended. As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements, the Corporation reviews long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired, and an impairment loss is recorded. The impairments recorded in 2020 were based on estimates of fair value determined by discounting internally developed future net cash flows, a Level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs used in determining the discounted future net cash flows include future prices, which are determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, projected production volumes using risk adjusted oil and gas reserves and discount rates. The projected production volumes are based on geological54and engineering evaluations of estimated in-place hydrocarbon volumes using financial and non-financial inputs including projected capital expenditures. Significant judgment is required by the Corporations’ internal petroleum engineering staff in evaluating the geological and engineering data used to estimate reserves. Estimating projected production volumes also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and natural gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others.Auditing the Corporation’s impairment calculation involved a high degree of subjectivity as the determination of fair value was based on assumptions as described above about future market and economic conditions. In addition, the cash flows include projected production volumes based on risk adjusted reserve estimates developed by the Corporation’s internal engineering staff.How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the impairment expense calculation. This included controls over the completeness and accuracy of the significant inputs used to estimate fair value including pricing assumptions and projected production volumes among others. Our testing of the Corporation’s impairment calculation included, among other procedures, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology used in the cash flow model, as well as certain of the inputs, including reserve risk adjustment factors and projected pricing among other market inputs. We additionally evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Corporation’s internal petroleum engineering specialist responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s reserve estimates and of the independent petroleum engineering specialist. We performed testing procedures including testing the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the estimation of oil and gas reserves by agreeing significant inputs to source documentation, where available, on a sample basis and assessing the inputs for reasonableness based on review of corroborative evidence and consideration of any contrary evidence. We also performed sensitivity analyses and a retrospective comparison of forecasted cash flows to actual historical data. Finally, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment calculations./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Corporation’s auditor since 1971New York, New YorkMarch 1, 202155HESS CORPORATION

Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting PoliciesUnless the context indicates otherwise, references to “Hess”, “the Corporation”, “Registrant”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the consolidated business operations of Hess Corporation and its affiliates.Nature of Business: Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global E&P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), Malaysia, and Denmark. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada.Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2020 (see Note 4, Hess Midstream LP) provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota.Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess Corporation and entities in which we own more than a 50% voting interest. Commencing December 16, 2019, we consolidate Hess Midstream LP, a variable interest entity that acquired Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), based on our conclusion that we have the power through Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. Prior to December 16, 2019, we consolidated HIP, also a variable interest entity based on the conclusion that we had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of HIP, and were obligated to absorb losses or had the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. Our undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas E&P ventures are proportionately consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned and where we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method.Estimates and Assumptions: In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves, asset and other valuations, depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes.Revenue Recognition:Exploration and ProductionThe E&P segment recognizes revenue from the sale of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as performance obligations under contracts with customers are satisfied. Our responsibilities to deliver each unit of quantity of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas under these contracts represent separate, distinct performance obligations. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer. Generally, the control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer upon the transfer of legal title at the point of physical delivery. Pricing is variable and is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials.For long-term international natural gas contracts with ship-or-pay provisions, our obligation to stand-ready to provide a minimum volume over each commitment period represents separate, distinct performance obligations. Penalties owed against future deliveries of natural gas due to delivery of volumes below minimum delivery commitments are recognized as reductions to revenue in the commitment period when the shortfall occurs. Long-term international natural gas contracts may also contain take-or-pay provisions whereby the customer is required to pay for volumes not taken that are below minimum volume commitments but the customer has certain make-up rights to receive shortfall volumes in subsequent periods. Shortfall payments received from customers when volumes purchased are below the minimum volume commitment are deferred upon receipt as a contract liability. Revenue is recognized at the earlier of when we deliver the make-up volumes in subsequent periods or when it becomes remote that the customer will exercise their make-up rights.Certain crude oil, NGL, and natural gas volumes are purchased by Hess from third parties, including working interest partners and royalty owners in certain Hess-operated properties, before they are sold to customers. Where control over the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas transfers to Hess before the volumes are transferred to the customer, revenue and the associated cost of purchased volumes are presented on a gross basis in the Statement of Consolidated Income within Sales and other operating revenues and Marketing, including purchased oil and gas, respectively. Where control of crude oil, NGL, or natural gas is not transferred to Hess, revenue is 61presented net of the associated cost of purchased volumes within Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income.Contract Duration and Pricing:Contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. crude oil, NGL, and natural gas primarily include those contracts that involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period, and those contracts that automatically renew on a periodic basis until either party cancels. We have certain long-term contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. natural gas and NGL that have remaining durations ranging from one to twelve years. Contracts with customers for the sale of international crude oil involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period. Pricing is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials, shortly after control of the volumes transfers to the customer. International contracts with customers for the sale of natural gas are in the form of natural gas sales agreements with government entities that have durations that are aligned with the durations of production sharing contracts or other contractual arrangements with host governments. Pricing is determined using contractual formulas that are based on the price of alternative fuels as obtained from price indices and other factors.Contract Balances:Our right to receive or collect payment from the customer is aligned with the timing of revenue recognition except in situations when we receive shortfall payments under contracts with take-or-pay provisions with customer make-up rights. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no contract assets or contract liabilities.Generally, we receive payments from customers on a monthly basis, shortly after the physical delivery of the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas.Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations:The transaction price allocated to our wholly unsatisfied performance obligations on uncompleted contracts is variable. Further, many of our contracts with customers have durations of less than twelve months. Accordingly, we have elected under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 the exemption from disclosure of revenue recognizable in future periods as these performance obligations are satisfied.Sales-based Taxes:We exclude sales-based taxes that are collected from customers from the transaction price in our contracts with customers. Accordingly, revenue from contracts with customers is net of sales-based taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities.MidstreamOur Midstream segment provides gathering, compression, processing, fractionation, storage, terminaling, loading and transportation, and water handling services.The Midstream segment has multiple long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with certain subsidiaries of Hess, each generally with an initial ten-year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. These contracts have minimum volumes the customer is obligated to provide each calendar quarter. The minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation based on nominations covering substantially all of our E&P segment’s production and projected third-party volumes that will be purchased in the Bakken. As the minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation, and as these contracts contain fee inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, substantially all of the transaction price at contract inception is variable. The midstream segment also has long-term, fee based commercial agreements for water handling services with a subsidiary of Hess with an initial 14 year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. Water handling services are provided for an agreed-upon fee per barrel or the reimbursement of third-party fees.The Midstream segment’s responsibilities to provide each of the above services for each year under each of the commercial agreements are considered separate, distinct performance obligations. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation under these commercial agreements over-time as services are rendered using the output method, measured using the amount of volumes serviced during the period. The Midstream segment has elected the practical expedient under the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers to recognize revenue in the amount it is entitled to invoice. If the commercial agreements have ship-or-pay provisions, the Midstream segment’s responsibility to stand-ready to service a minimum volume over each quarterly commitment period represent separate, distinct performance obligations. Shortfall payments received under ship-or-pay provisions are recognized as revenue in the calendar quarter the shortfall occurs as the customer does not have make-up rights beyond the calendar 62quarter end of the quarterly commitment period. All revenues, receivables, and contract balances arising from the commercial agreements between the Midstream segment and the Hess subsidiaries that are the counterparty to the commercial agreements are eliminated upon consolidation.On December 30, 2020, Hess Midstream exercised its renewal options to extend the terms of certain gas gathering, crude oil gathering, gas processing and fractionation, storage, and terminal and export commercial agreements for the secondary term through December 31, 2033. There were no changes to any provisions of the existing commercial agreements as a result of the exercise of the renewal options.Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: We record depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production facilities and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.Capitalized Interest: Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets.Impairment of Long‑lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements.In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a projected amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows reported in Supplementary Oil and Gas Data, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices. As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices in the first quarter of 2020, we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment at March 31, 2020. See Note 12, Impairment.Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over fair value, limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2020, goodwill of $360 million relates to the Midstream operating segment.Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily comprises cash on hand and on deposit, as well as highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired.Inventories: Produced and unsold crude oil and NGL are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost of production plus any transport cost incurred in bringing the volumes to their present location. Materials and 63supplies are valued at cost. Obsolete or surplus materials identified during periodic reviews are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.Leases: We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception by evaluating whether the contract conveys the right to control an identified asset during the period of use. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an identified asset for the lease term and lease obligations represent our obligation to make payments as set forth in the lease arrangement. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as operating leases or finance leases at the commencement date based on the present value of the minimum lease payments over the lease term. Where the implicit discount rate in a lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date for determining the present value of the minimum lease payments. The lease term used in measurement of our lease obligations includes options to extend or terminate the lease when, in our judgment, it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the measurement of lease obligations using the index or rate at the commencement date. Variable lease payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances after the commencement date of the lease are not included in the minimum lease payments used to measure lease obligations. We have agreements that include financial obligations for lease and nonlease components. For purposes of measuring lease obligations, we have elected not to separate nonlease components from lease components for the following classes of assets: drilling rigs, office space, offshore vessels, and aircraft. We apply a portfolio approach to account for operating lease ROU assets and liabilities for certain vehicles, railcars, field equipment and office equipment leases.Finance lease cost is recognized as amortization of the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. Operating lease cost is generally recognized on a straight-line basis. Operating lease costs for drilling rigs used to drill development wells and successful exploration wells are capitalized. Operating lease cost for other ROU assets used in oil and gas producing activities are either capitalized or expensed on a straight-line basis based on the nature of operation for which the ROU asset is utilized.Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as permitted under ASC 842. We recognize lease cost for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Some of our leases include one or more options to renew. The renewal option is at our sole discretion and is not included in the lease term for measurement of the lease obligation unless we are reasonably certain at the commencement date of the lease, to renew the lease.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. We assign cumulative historical losses significant weight in the evaluation of realizability relative to more subjective evidence such as forecasts of future income. In addition, we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We are no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to the book in excess of tax basis in the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Because of U.S. tax reform we expect that the future reversal of such temporary differences will occur free of material taxation. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. We account for the U.S. tax effect of global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries in the period that such income is earned. We utilize the aggregate approach for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or the seabed at certain E&P locations. We initially recognize a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred and capitalize the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long‑lived assets. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Fair value is determined by applying a credit adjusted risk-free rate to the undiscounted expected future abandonment expenditures. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Income.Retirement Plans: We recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. We recognize the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur. Actuarial gains and losses in 64excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the remaining average expected life if a plan’s participants are predominantly inactive.Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments for financial risk management activities. In these activities, we may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by GAAP. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying nonmonetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long‑lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows:Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity.Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange-traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded contracts.Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3.Netting of Financial Instruments: We generally enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate legal and counterparty credit risk. Master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty, commonly known as the “safe harbor” provisions. If a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterparty’s bankruptcy, these rights are generally enforceable with respect to “safe harbor” transactions. If these arrangements provide the right of offset and our intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination, our policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis. In the normal course of business, we rely on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses providing for adequate credit assurance as well as close‑out netting, including two‑party netting and single counterparty multilateral netting. As applied to us, “two‑party netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single Hess entity, and “single counterparty multilateral netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple Hess entities. We are reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.Share-based Compensation: We account for share-based compensation based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value of all share‑based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting terms, net of actual forfeitures. We estimate fair value at the date of grant using a 65Black‑Scholes valuation model for employee stock options and a Monte Carlo simulation model for performance share units (PSUs). Fair value of restricted stock is based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant.Foreign Currency Translation: The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in which business is conducted) for our foreign operations. Adjustments resulting from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.Maintenance and Repairs: Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capital improvements are recorded as additions in Property, plant and equipment.Environmental Expenditures: We accrue and expense the undiscounted environmental costs necessary to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year‑end 2020, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $65 million. Environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment are capitalized.New Accounting Pronouncements: In the first quarter of 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. This ASU makes changes to the impairment model for trade receivables, net investments in leases, debt securities, loans and certain other instruments. The standard requires the use of a forward-looking ""expected loss"" model compared with the prior ""incurred loss"" model. We calculate expected credit losses for our receivables using the probability of default and the expected loss given default. Historical data, current market conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions are used to determine the probability of default and the expected loss given default. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to our financial statements.2. InventoriesInventories at December 31 were as follows: 20202019 (In millions)Crude oil and natural gas liquids$226 $92 Materials and supplies152 169 Total Inventories$378 $261 In the first quarter of 2020, we recognized charges of $53 million ($52 million after income taxes) recorded in Marketing, including purchased oil and gas to reflect crude oil inventories at net realizable value at March 31, 2020.In 2020, we chartered three VLCCs to load and transport a total of 6.3 million barrels of Bakken crude oil for sale in Asian markets. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in September 2020. We have entered into agreements for the sale of the remaining 4.2 million barrels of crude oil loaded on the second and third VLCCs in the first quarter of 2021. At December 31, 2020, crude oil inventories included $164 million associated with the cost of these volumes.3.

Other drilling activity included the Esox prospect in the Gulf of Mexico during 2019 and the Bunga prospect in the North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia during 2018.Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves in 2020 resulted from sanctions of the Payara Field development on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, and an additional phase of development at the North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia. In 2019, reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment resulted from sanction of the Liza Phase 2 development on the Stabroek Block and the Esox tieback well to the Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico.Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense in 2020 included $125 million, primarily related to the northern portion of the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) in the Gulf of Mexico due to reprioritization of our forward capital program in response to the significant decline in crude oil prices. In 2018, in Canada, offshore Nova Scotia (Hess 50% participating interest), the operator, BP Canada, completed drilling of the Aspy exploration well, which did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. As a result, we expensed well costs totaling $120 million in 2018, of which $14 million was incurred in 2017. The preceding table excludes well costs incurred and expensed during 2020 of $67 million (2019: $49 million; 2018: $151 million).Exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling were $342 million at December 31, 2020, separated by year of completion as follows (in millions):2019$173 2018105 201727 2016— 201537 $342 Guyana: Approximately 85% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to successful exploration wells where hydrocarbons were encountered on the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana. The operator plans further appraisal drilling and is conducting pre-development planning for additional phases of development beyond the three previously sanctioned development projects on the Block.JDA: Approximately 10% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the JDA (Hess 50%) in the Gulf of Thailand, where hydrocarbons were encountered in three successful exploration wells drilled in the western part of Block A-18. The operator has submitted a development plan concept to the regulator to facilitate ongoing commercial negotiations for an extension of the existing gas sales contract to include development of the western part of the Block.Malaysia: Approximately 5% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to North Malay Basin (Hess 50%), offshore Peninsular Malaysia, where hydrocarbons were encountered in one successful exploration well. Subsurface evaluation and pre-development studies for future phases of development are ongoing.4. Hess Midstream LPPrior to December 16, 2019, the Midstream segment was primarily comprised of HIP, a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), formed to own, operate, develop and acquire a diverse set of midstream assets to provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers. HIP was initially formed on May 21, 2015, with Hess selling 50% of HIP to GIP for approximately $2.6 billion on July 1, 2015.On April 10, 2017, HIP completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 16,997,000 common units, representing 30.5% limited partnership interests in its subsidiary Hess Midstream Partners LP (Hess Midstream Partners), for net proceeds of approximately 67$365.5 million. In connection with the IPO, HIP contributed a 20% controlling economic interest in each of Hess North Dakota Pipeline Operations LP, Hess TGP Operations LP, and Hess North Dakota Export Logistics Operations LP, and a 100% economic interest in Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC (collectively the “Contributed Businesses”). In exchange for the contributed businesses, Hess and GIP each received common and subordinated units representing a direct 33.75% limited partner interest in Hess Midstream Partners and a 50% indirect ownership interest through HIP in Hess Midstream Partners’ general partner, which had a 2% economic interest in Hess Midstream Partners plus incentive distribution rights.On March 1, 2019, HIP acquired Hess’s existing Bakken water services business for $225 million in cash. As a result of this transaction, we recorded an after-tax gain of $78 million in additional paid-in capital with an offsetting reduction to noncontrolling interest to reflect the adjustment to GIP’s noncontrolling interest in HIP. On March 22, 2019, HIP and Hess Midstream Partners acquired crude oil and gas gathering assets, and HIP acquired water gathering assets of Summit Midstream Partners LP’s Tioga Gathering System for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $90 million, with the potential for an additional $10 million of contingent payments in future periods subject to certain future performance metrics. On January 25, 2018, Hess Midstream Partners entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources Corp. to construct a new 200 million standard cubic feet per day gas processing plant called Little Missouri 4 (LM4). The plant, which is operated by Targa, was placed into service in the third quarter of 2019.On December 16, 2019, Hess Midstream Partners acquired HIP, including HIP’s 80% interest in Hess Midstream Partners’ oil and gas midstream assets, HIP’s water services business and the outstanding economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in Hess Midstream Partners LP. In addition, Hess Midstream Partners’ organizational structure converted from a master limited partnership into an “Up-C” structure in which Hess Midstream Partners’ public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares in a new public entity named Hess Midstream LP (Hess Midstream), which is taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Hess Midstream Partners changed its name to “Hess Midstream Operations LP” (HESM Opco) and became a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream, the new publicly listed entity. As consideration for the acquisition, Hess received a cash payment of $301 million and approximately 115 million newly issued HESM Opco Class B units. After giving effect to the acquisition and related transactions, public shareholders of Class A shares in Hess Midstream own 6% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis and Hess and GIP each own 47% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis, primarily through the sponsors’ ownership of Class B units in HESM Opco that are exchangeable into Class A shares of Hess Midstream on a one-for-one basis, or referred to as “Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership in Hess Midstream LP”.At December 31, 2020, Hess Midstream liabilities totaling $2,026 million (2019: $1,941 million) are on a nonrecourse basis to Hess Corporation, while Hess Midstream assets available to settle the obligations of Hess Midstream included Cash and cash equivalents totaling $3 million (2019: $3 million), Property, plant and equipment, net totaling $3,111 million (2019: $3,010 million) and an equity-method investment of $108 million (2019: $108 million) in LM4. 5.

Variable lease costs for logistical assets result from differences in stated monthly rates and total charges reflecting the actual usage of the ROU asset during the lease period. Variable lease costs for our office leases represent common area maintenance charges which have not been separated from lease components.(c)We sublease certain of our office space to third parties under our head lease.(d)Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, we incurred total rental expense of $154 million and income from subleases of $8 million in 2018.The above lease costs represent 100% of the lease payments due for the period, including where we as operator have contracted directly with suppliers. As the payments under lease agreements where we are operator become due, we bill our partners their proportionate share for reimbursement pursuant to the terms of our joint operating agreements. Reimbursements are not reflected in the table above.

The indentures for our fixed-rate public notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15%. As of December 31, 2020, Hess Corporation was in compliance with this financial covenant.Term loan and credit facility:In 2020, we entered into a $1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of March 16, 2023. Borrowings under the term loan generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 2.25% until the term loan's first anniversary. The 71applicable margin varies based on the credit rating of the Corporation’s senior unsecured long-term debt and will increase by 0.25% on each anniversary of the term loan.In 2019, we entered into a new $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 15, 2023, which replaced the Corporation’s previous revolving credit facility. The new facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings will generally bear interest at 1.30% above LIBOR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. At December 31, 2020, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility.Both the term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15% (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement). As of December 31, 2020, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants.The most restrictive of the financial covenants related to our fixed-rate public notes and our term loan and revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional $1,730 million of secured debt at December 31, 2020.Other outstanding letters of credit at December 31 were as follows: 20202019 (In millions)Committed lines (a)$54 $54 Uncommitted lines (a)215 218 Total$269 $272 (a)At December 31, 2020, committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2021.Debt - Midstream:Senior unsecured fixed-rate public notes:In November 2017, HIP issued $800 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2026. In December 2019, in connection with the acquisition of HIP and corporate restructuring described in Note 4, Hess Midstream LP, HESM Opco assumed $800 million of outstanding HIP senior notes in a par-for-par exchange. The senior notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of HESM Opco. In addition, in December 2019, HESM Opco issued $550 million of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due in 2028. The notes are guaranteed by HESM Opco’s direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. Proceeds of the new notes were used to finance the acquisition of HIP and repay outstanding borrowings under HIP’s credit facilities.Credit facilities:Prior to the closing of the December 2019 transaction, HIP had a $600 million 5-year senior secured revolving credit facility and a $200 million senior secured Term Loan A facility, while Hess Midstream Partners LP had a $300 million 4-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility. In connection with the acquisition of HIP, both HIP and Hess Midstream Partners LP retired their existing senior secured revolving credit facilities and HESM Opco entered into a new 5-year senior secured syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.0 billion. HIP also retired its senior secured Term Loan A facility, which had borrowings of $190 million excluding deferred issuance costs, and HESM Opco entered into a fully drawn $400 million 5-year Term Loan A facility, receiving cash of $210 million at closing. The new revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund HESM Opco’s operating activities, capital expenditures, distributions and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA as defined in the credit facilities. If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all the presently owned and after-acquired assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2020, borrowings of $184 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s Term Loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation.728.

The liabilities settled or disposed of in 2020 primarily reflect an asset sale in the Gulf of Mexico and abandonment activity completed in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bakken and the U.K. North Sea, while 2019 primarily relates to abandonment activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken. Revisions of estimated liabilities in 2020 and 2019 reflect an acceleration of planned abandonment activity in the Gulf of Mexico and changes in service and equipment rates.Sinking fund deposits that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations, which are reported in non-current Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, were $207 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: $178 million).739. Retirement PlansWe have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a significant portion of our employees. In addition, we have an unfunded supplemental pension plan covering certain employees, which provides incremental payments that would have been payable from our principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary to U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2017 and to U.K. employees. U.S. employees hired on or after January 1, 2017 participate under a cash accumulation formula and receive credits to a notional account based on a percentage of pensionable wages. Interest accrues on the balance in the notional account at a rate determined in accordance with plan provisions. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded postretirement medical plan that provides health benefits to certain U.S. qualified retirees from ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement plans is December 31.The following table summarizes the benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of our pension and postretirement medical plans:FundedPension PlansUnfundedPension PlanPostretirementMedical Plan 202020192020201920202019 (In millions)Change in Benefit Obligation Balance at January 1, $2,667 $2,492 $242 $216 $75 $59 Service cost 37 33 13 11 3 2 Interest cost 68 82 5 7 1 2 Actuarial (gains) loss (a) 385 401 26 22 (8)19 Single premium annuity contract payment— (249)— — — — Benefit payments (b) (93)(113)(17)(14)(6)(7)Foreign currency exchange rate changes 21 21 — — — — Balance at December 31, (c)3,085 2,667 269 242 65 75 Change in Fair Value of Plan AssetsBalance at January 1,$2,732 $2,568 $— $— $— $— Actual return on plan assets 378 462 — — — — Employer contributions 4 40 17 14 6 7 Single premium annuity contract payment— (249)— — — — Benefit payments (b) (93)(113)(17)(14)(6)(7)Foreign currency exchange rate changes 22 24 — — — — Balance at December 31,3,043 2,732 — — — — Funded Status (Plan assets greater (less) than benefit obligations) at December 31,$(42)$65 $(269)$(242)$(65)$(75)Unrecognized Net Actuarial (Gains) Losses$900 $756 $86 $65 $(19)$(12)(a)Changes in discount rates resulted in actuarial losses of $387 million in 2020 (2019: $465 million).

The settlement transaction resulted in a noncash charge of $88 million to recognize unamortized pension actuarial losses that is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.In 2021, we forecast service cost for our pension and postretirement medical plans to be approximately $55 million and net non-service cost of approximately $85 million of income, which is comprised of interest cost of approximately $55 million, amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses of approximately $55 million, and estimated expected return on plan assets of approximately $195 million.Assumptions: The weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 and net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended December 31 for our funded and unfunded pension plans were as follows: 202020192018Benefit Obligations: Discount rate 2.2%2.9%3.9%Rate of compensation increase 3.8%3.8%3.8%Net Periodic Benefit Cost:Discount rateService cost3.2%3.9%3.9%Interest cost2.6%3.4%3.3%Expected return on plan assets 6.7%7.1%7.2%Rate of compensation increase 3.8%3.8%4.5%The actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 for the postretirement medical plan were as follows: 202020192018Discount rate 1.9%2.8%3.9%Initial health care trend rate 6.0%6.5%6.9%Ultimate trend rate 4.5%4.5%4.5%Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 203820382038The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year‑end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations.The overall expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories.Our investment strategy is to maximize long‑term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes. Asset classes and target allocations are determined by our investment committee and include domestic and foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities issued by us unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets 75are highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements. The current target allocations for plan assets are 45% equity securities, 35% fixed income securities (including cash and short‑term investment funds) and 20% to all other types of investments. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target levels.Fair value: The following tables provide the fair value of the financial assets of the funded pension plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 in accordance with the fair value measurement hierarchy described in Note 1, Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies.

The following describes the financial assets of the funded pension plans:Cash and short‑term investment funds - Consists of cash on hand and short-term investment funds that provide for daily investments and redemptions which are classified as Level 1.Equities - Consists of individually held U.S. and international equity securities. This investment category also includes funds that consist primarily of U.S. and international equity securities. Equity securities, which are individually held and are traded actively on exchanges, are classified as Level 1. Certain funds, consisting primarily of equity securities, are classified as Level 2 if the NAV is determined and published daily, and is the basis for current transactions. Commingled funds, consisting primarily of equity securities, are valued using the NAV per fund share.Fixed income investments - Consists of individually held securities issued by the U.S. government, non-U.S. governments, governmental agencies, municipalities and corporations, and agency and non-agency mortgage backed securities. This investment category also includes funds that consist of fixed income securities. Individual fixed income securities are generally priced based on 76evaluated prices from independent pricing services, which are monitored and provided by the third-party custodial firm responsible for safekeeping assets of the particular plan and are classified as Level 2. Certain funds, consisting primarily of fixed income securities, are classified as Level 2 if the NAV is determined and published daily, and is the basis for current transactions. Commingled funds, consisting primarily of fixed income securities, are valued using the NAV per fund share.Other investments - Consists of exchange‑traded real estate investment trust securities, which are classified as Level 1. Commingled funds and limited partnership investments in hedge funds, private equity and real estate funds are valued at the NAV per fund share.Contributions and estimated future benefit payments: To preserve cash in 2021, we are minimizing non-required cash contributions to funded pension plans. In 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $4 million to our funded pension plans.Estimated future benefit payments by the funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, which reflect expected future service, are as follows (in millions):2021$151 2022134 2023133 2024137 2025130 Years 2026 to 2030687 We also have defined contribution plans for certain eligible employees.

Dispositions2020: We completed the sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for proceeds of $482 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $79 million ($79 million after income taxes).2019: We completed the sale of our remaining acreage in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio for proceeds of $22 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes).2018: We completed the sale of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio for proceeds of $396 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($14 million after income taxes). In addition, we completed the sale of our interests in Ghana for total consideration of $100 million, consisting of a $25 million payment that was received at closing and a further payment of $75 million that is payable to us upon the buyer receiving government approval for a Plan of Development on the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block. The receipt of proceeds at closing resulted in a pre-tax gain of $10 million ($10 million after income taxes). 7812. ImpairmentOil and Gas Properties:As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the global economic slowdown from the COVID-19 pandemic, we reviewed our oil and gas properties within the Exploration and Production operating segment for impairment in the first quarter of 2020. We recognized pre-tax impairment charges in the first quarter of 2020 to reduce the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and certain related right-of-use assets at the North Malay Basin in Malaysia by $755 million ($755 million after income taxes), the South Arne Field in Denmark by $670 million ($594 million after income taxes), and in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede Field by $410 million ($410 million after income taxes) and the Tubular Bells Field by $270 million ($270 million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The impairment charges were based on estimates of fair value at March 31, 2020 determined by discounting internally developed future net cash flows, a Level 3 fair value measurement. The total of the fair value estimates was approximately $1.05 billion. Significant inputs used in determining the discounted future net cash flows include future prices, projected production volumes using risk adjusted oil and gas reserves, and discount rates. The future pricing assumptions used were based on forward strip crude oil prices as of March 31, 2020 for the remainder of 2020 through 2022, and $50 per barrel for WTI ($55 per barrel for Brent) in 2023 and thereafter to the end of field life. The weighted average crude oil benchmark price based on total projected crude oil volumes for the impaired assets was $48.82 per barrel. A discount rate of 10% was used in each of the fair value measurements which represents the estimated discount rate a market participant would use. We determined the discount rate by considering the weighted average cost of capital for a group of peer companies.Other Assets:In the first quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges totaling $21 million pre-tax ($20 million after income taxes) related to drilling rig right-of-use assets in the Bakken and surplus materials and supplies.13. Exit and Disposal CostsWe incurred employee termination costs of $27 million in 2020 and $38 million in 2018 related to cost reduction initiatives and asset sales in 2018. All charges were based on amounts incurred under ongoing severance arrangements or other statutory requirements, plus amounts earned under enhanced benefit arrangements. Payments for termination costs were $20 million in 2020 (2019: $4 million; 2018: $40 million).14. Share-based CompensationWe have established and maintain long term incentive plans (LTIP) for the granting of restricted common shares, performance share units (PSUs) and stock options to our employees. At December 31, 2020, the total number of authorized common stock under the LTIP was 51.5 million shares, of which we have 13.0 million shares available for issuance. Share‑based compensation expense consisted of the following: 202020192018 (In millions)Restricted stock$51 $53 $40 Performance share units18 22 22 Stock options10 10 10 Share-based compensation expense before income taxes$79 $85 $72 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation expense$— $— $— Based on share‑based compensation awards outstanding at December 31, 2020, unearned compensation expense, before income taxes, will be recognized in future years as follows (in millions): 2021: $49, 2022: $26 and 2023: $4. 79Our share-based compensation plans can be summarized as follows:Restricted stock: Restricted stock generally vests equally on an annual basis over a three-year term and is valued based on the prevailing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.

The number of shares of common stock to be issued under a PSU agreement is based on a comparison of the Corporation’s total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies over a three-year performance period ending December 31 of the year prior to settlement of the grant. Beginning with the PSUs granted in 2020, the Corporation's TSR is compared to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies and the S&P 500 index over the three-year performance period. Payouts of the performance share awards will range from 0% to 200% of the target awards based on the Corporation’s TSR ranking within the peer group. Dividend equivalents for the performance period will accrue on performance shares but will only be paid out on earned shares after the performance period.

The deferred tax asset is comprised of $1,121 million attributable to foreign net operating losses which begin to expire in 2025, $3,277 million attributable to U.S. federal operating losses which begin to expire in 2034, and $639 million attributable to losses in various U.S. states which begin to expire in 2021. The deferred tax asset attributable to foreign net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, is $155 million. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to U.S. federal and state net operating losses, except for $3 million U.S. federal and $1 million U.S. state deferred tax asset attributable to Midstream activities. At December 31, 2020, we have U.S. federal, state and foreign alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $49 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely, and approximately $83 million of other business credit carryforwards. The deferred tax asset attributable to these credits, net of valuation allowances was not significant. A full valuation allowance is established against our foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3 million, which begin to expire in 2021.At December 31, 2020, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $5,391 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on application of the relevant accounting standards. Hess continues to maintain a full valuation 82allowance against its deferred tax assets in the U.S., Denmark, and Malaysia. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. The cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ending December 31, 2020 constitutes significant objective negative evidence. Such objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider subjective positive evidence, such as our projections of future taxable income, resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for these jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence. At December 31, 2019 the valuation allowance established against the net deferred tax asset in Guyana for the Stabroek Block was released as a result of the positive evidence from first production in December 2019, and the significant forecasted pre-tax income from operations. The cumulative pre-tax losses in Guyana were driven by pre-production activities.Below is a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: 202020192018 (In millions)Balance at January 1$168 $168 $205 Additions based on tax positions taken in the current year2 2 19 Additions based on tax positions of prior years1 1 36 Reductions based on tax positions of prior years(2)(1)(78)Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities(1)— (10)Reductions due to lapses in statutes of limitation(2)(2)(4)Balance at December 31$166 $168 $168 The December 31, 2020 balance of unrecognized tax benefits includes $16 million that, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between zero and $41 million due to settlements with taxing authorities or other resolutions, as well as lapses in statutes of limitation. At December 31, 2020, our accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is $6 million (2019: $7 million).We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to examinations by income tax authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2010. 8316.

Guarantees, Contingencies and CommitmentsGuarantees and ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages.We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are three remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In September 2016, the State of Rhode Island also filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Rhode Island by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit filed in Rhode Island is proceeding in federal court. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit, filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants.In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and agreed with the EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total 85remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages.In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. The remedy selected by the EPA includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. The EPA’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA’s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us, and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design.From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. Beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. These proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Beginning in 2013, various parishes in Louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies, including us, alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, the payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. The ultimate impact of the aforementioned proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates.We are also involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings from time to time in addition to the matters described above, including claims related to post-production deductions from royalty payments. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding.Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.Unconditional Purchase Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table shows aggregate information for certain unconditional purchase obligations and commitments at December 31, 2020, which are not included elsewhere within these Consolidated Financial Statements: Payments Due by PeriodTotal20212022 and20232024 and2025Thereafter (In millions)Capital expenditures$2,837 $868 $1,469 $500 $— Operating expenses236 167 63 5 1 Transportation and related contracts2,867 310 756 493 1,308 8619. Segment InformationWe currently have two operating segments, E&P and Midstream. The E&P operating segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases and sells crude oil, NGL and natural gas. Production operations over the three years ended December 31, 2020 were in the United States (U.S.), Malaysia and the JDA, Denmark, Libya, and Guyana commencing December 2019. The Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of NGL, transportation of crude oil by rail car, terminaling and loading crude oil and NGL, storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota. All unallocated costs are reflected under Corporate, Interest and Other.The following table presents operating segment financial data (in millions): Exploration and ProductionMidstreamCorporate, Interest and OtherEliminationsTotal2020 Sales and Other Operating Revenues - Third parties$4,667 $— $— $— $4,667 Intersegment Revenues— 1,092 — (1,092)— Sales and Other Operating Revenues$4,667 $1,092 $— $(1,092)$4,667 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$(2,841)$230 $(482)$— $(3,093)Interest Expense— 95 373 — 468 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization1,915 157 2 — 2,074 Impairment2,126 — — — 2,126 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes (a)(12)7 (6)— (11)Investment in Affiliates104 108 — — 212 Identifiable Assets13,688 3,599 1,534 — 18,821 Capital Expenditures1,678 253 — — 1,931 2019Sales and Other Operating Revenues - Third parties$6,495 $— $— $— $6,495 Intersegment Revenues— 848 — (848)— Sales and Other Operating Revenues$6,495 $848 $— $(848)$6,495 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$53 $144 $(605)$— $(408)Interest Expense— 63 317 — 380 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization1,977 142 3 — 2,122 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes (a)375 — 86 — 461 Investment in Affiliates114 108 — — 222 Identifiable Assets16,790 3,499 1,493 — 21,782 Capital Expenditures2,576 416 — — 2,992 2018Sales and Other Operating Revenues - Third parties$6,323 $— $— $— $6,323 Intersegment Revenues— 713 — (713)— Sales and Other Operating Revenues$6,323 $713 $— $(713)$6,323 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$51 $120 $(453)$— $(282)Interest Expense— 60 339 — 399 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization1,748 127 8 — 1,883 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes (a)391 38 (94)— 335 Capital Expenditures1,909 271 — — 2,180 (a)Commencing January 1, 2019, management changed its measurement of segment earnings to reflect income taxes on a post U.S. tax consolidation and valuation allowance assessment basis. In 2018, the provision for income taxes in the Midstream segment was presented before consolidating its operations with other U.S. activities of the Corporation and prior to evaluating realizability of net U.S. deferred taxes. An offsetting impact was presented in the E&P segment. If 2018 segment results were prepared on a basis consistent with 2020 and 2019, Midstream segment net income attributable to Hess Corporation would have been $158 million and E&P net income attributable to Hess Corporation would have been $13 million. 87The following table presents financial information by major geographic area: United StatesGuyanaMalaysia and JDAOtherCorporate, Interest and otherTotal (In millions)2020 Sales and Other Operating Revenues$3,604 $350 $511 $202 $— $4,667 Property, Plant and Equipment (Net) (a)10,384 2,114 1,067 539 11 14,115 2019Sales and Other Operating Revenues$5,043 $— $762 $690 $— $6,495 Property, Plant and Equipment (Net) (a)12,182 1,507 1,890 1,223 12 16,814 2018Sales and Other Operating Revenues$4,842 $— $769 $712 $— $6,323 (a)Property, plant and equipment in the United States, in 2020, includes $7,273 million (2019: $9,172 million) attributable to the E&P segment and $3,111 million (2019: $3,010 million) attributable to the Midstream segment.20. Financial Risk Management ActivitiesIn the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, corporate financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. We maintain a control environment for all of our financial risk management activities under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Corporate Financial Risk Management Activities: Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas we produce or by reducing our exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to fix the forward selling price of a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production. Swaps may also be used to fix the difference between current selling prices and forward selling prices in periods of contango for crude oil production that will be stored and sold in the future. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we conduct business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. At December 31, 2020, these forward contracts relate to the British Pound, Danish Krone, Canadian Dollar and Malaysian Ringgit. Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates.The notional amounts of outstanding financial risk management derivative contracts were as follows: December 31, 2020December 31, 2019 (In millions)Commodity - crude oil put options (millions of barrels)27.4 54.9 Foreign exchange forwards$163 $90 Interest rate swaps$100 $100 At December 31, 2020, we had WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of approximately $45 per barrel for 75,000 bopd for 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, we increased the average monthly floor price of 75,000 bopd of WTI put option contracts from approximately $45 per barrel to $50 per barrel for the remainder of 2021. We also purchased additional WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel for 45,000 bopd and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 30,000 bopd. As a result, we now have total purchased WTI put options of 120,000 bopd with an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel and total purchased Brent put options of 30,000 bopd with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for the remainder of 2021. 88The table below reflects the gross and net fair values of risk management derivative instruments: AssetsLiabilities (In millions)December 31, 2020 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments: Crude oil put options$64 $— Crude oil swaps— (54)Interest rate swaps5 — Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments69 (54)Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Foreign exchange forwards— (1)Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments— (1)Gross fair value of derivative contracts69 (55)Gross amount offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet(13)13 Net Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet$56 $(42)December 31, 2019Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments:Crude oil put options$125 $— Interest rate swaps1 — Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments126 — Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Foreign exchange forwards— (1)Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments— (1)Gross fair value of derivative contracts126 (1)Gross amount offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet— — Net Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet$126 $(1)In 2020, we chartered three VLCCs to load and transport a total of 6.3 million barrels of Bakken crude oil for sale in Asian markets. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in September 2020. We have entered into agreements for the sale of the remaining 4.2 million barrels of crude oil in the first quarter of 2021. In connection with this activity, we entered into Brent swap transactions intended to fix the difference between Brent prices in the month of production and the forward Brent price for the expected month of sale. At December 31, 2020, net realized and unrealized losses from the Brent swaps of $16 million were deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income, and the liability for unrealized losses from the Brent swaps was $54 million. In addition, total net realized gains from WTI put options associated with the VLCCs of $40 million were deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2020.The fair value of our crude oil put options and crude oil swaps is presented within Other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is presented within Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of our foreign exchange forwards is presented within Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. All fair values in the table above are based on Level 2 inputs.Derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments:Crude oil derivatives: In 2020, crude oil price hedging contracts increased Sales and other operating revenues by $547 million (2019: increase of $1 million; 2018: decrease of $161 million). At December 31, 2020, pre-tax deferred gains in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to outstanding crude oil price hedging contracts were $4 million, of which all will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings.Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: At December 31, 2020, we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $100 million (2019: $100 million), which were designated as fair value hedges and relate to long-term debt where we have converted interest payments from fixed to floating rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and the hedged fixed‑rate debt are recorded in Interest expense in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2020, the change in fair value of interest rate swaps was an increase in the asset of $4 million (2019: $3 million decrease in liability; 2018: $1 million increase in liability) with a corresponding adjustment in the carrying value of the hedged fixed‑rate debt.Derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments:Foreign exchange: Total foreign exchange gains and losses were losses of $6 million in 2020 (2019: gain of $3 million; 2018: loss of $5 million) and are reported in Other, net in Revenues and non-operating income in the Statement of Consolidated Income. A 89component of foreign exchange gains or losses is the result of foreign exchange derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges, which amounted to a gain of $2 million in 2020 (2019: loss of $2 million; 2018: loss of $2 million).Crude oil collars: In 2018, noncash adjustments to de-designated crude oil price hedging contracts decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $22 million.Credit Risk: We are exposed to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, groups of counterparties or customers. Accounts receivable are generated from a diverse domestic and international customer base. At December 31, 2020, our Accounts receivable were concentrated with the following counterparty industry segments: Integrated companies — 39%, Independent E&P companies — 39%, Refining and marketing companies — 8%, National oil companies — 5%, Storage and transportation companies — 5%, and Others — 4%. We reduce risk related to certain counterparties, where applicable, by using master netting arrangements and requiring collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $269 million (2019: $272 million). Fair Value Measurement: At December 31, 2020, our total long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments, had a carrying value of $8,296 million and a fair value of $9,647 million, based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. We also have short-term financial instruments, primarily cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, for which the carrying value approximated fair value at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 90HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIESSUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DATA (UNAUDITED)The Supplementary Oil and Gas Data that follows is presented in accordance with ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities, and includes (1) costs incurred, capitalized costs and results of operations relating to oil and gas producing activities, (2) net proved oil and gas reserves and (3) a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves, including a reconciliation of changes therein. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, we produced crude oil, NGL and natural gas in the United States (U.S.), Malaysia and the JDA, Denmark, Libya, and Guyana commencing December 2019.

Proved oil and gas reserves are quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by our internal teams of geoscience and reservoir engineering professionals. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of June 25, 2019).” The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir, the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate, the stage of reservoir development and the production history. Subsurface data used included well logs, reservoir core and fluid samples, production and pressure testing, static and dynamic pressure information, and reservoir surveillance. Where applicable, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC regulations. These technologies, including computational methods, must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In some cases, where appropriate, use of empirical and analytical methods, combined with analog data were used. Analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies were used to increase the quality and confidence in the reserves estimates. In order for reserves to be classified as proved, any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project, either senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the development. Our proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10‑K.Internal ControlsThe Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation processes, which are administered by our Global Reserves group and our Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff who work directly with the oil and gas properties using industry standard reserve estimation principles, definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates of the Corporation’s assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an independent third-party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves (see pages 93 through 97). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors.QualificationsThe person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves during 2020 was the Senior Manager, Global Reserves. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has 18 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a MSc degree in Petroleum Engineering. His experience has been primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas. He is also responsible for the Corporation’s Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization that establishes the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews.Reserves AuditWe engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 92% of 2020 year‑end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (2019: 80%). The purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D&M report, dated February 3, 2021, on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry. D&M is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. D&M’s letter report on the Corporation’s December 31, 2020 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this Form 10‑K. While the D&M report should be read in its entirety, the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M, the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and audited by D&M, in the aggregate, differed by less than 1% (2019: less than 1%) of total audited net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The report also includes among other information, the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve audit.Crude Oil Prices Used to Estimate Proved ReservesProved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period before December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2020 were $39.77 per barrel for WTI (2019: $55.73; 2018: $65.55) and $43.43 per barrel for Brent (2019: 93$62.54; 2018: $72.08). New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were $2.16 per mcf in 2020 (2019: $2.54; 2018: $3.01).At December 31, 2020, spot prices for WTI oil closed at $48.52 per barrel. If crude oil prices in 2021 are at levels below that used in determining 2020 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2021 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2021 above those used in determining 2020 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2021, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2021 crude oil prices, the amount of any additions to proved reserves, positive or negative revisions in proved reserves related to 2021 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2021 crude oil prices, and management’s plans as of December 31, 2021 for developing proved undeveloped reserves.

Additions to proved developed reserves primarily resulted from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 130 million boe (98 million barrels of crude oil, 16 million barrels of NGL and 93 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 96.2019: Total Additions were 228 million boe, of which 25 million boe (13 million barrels of crude oil, 6 million barrels of NGL and 35 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves primarily resulted from new wells drilled in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions in the U.S. also included two wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 203 million boe (144 million barrels of crude oil, 34 million barrels of NGL and 149 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 97.2018: Total Additions were 213 million boe, of which 6 million boe (3 million barrels of crude oil and 18 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves were primarily from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 207 million boe (122 million barrels of crude oil, 39 million barrels of NGL and 274 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 97. 95Revisions of previous estimates2020: Total revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves amounted to a net decrease of 25 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to an increase of 108 million boe (38 million barrels of crude oil, 30 million barrels of NGL and 237 million mcf of natural gas). In the U.S., revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken were a net increase of 55 million boe, comprised of positive revisions of 77 million boe and negative price revisions of 22 million boe. The positive revisions resulted from well performance (50%), updated yield and decline factors (30%) and other changes (20%), primarily driven by cost reductions. In the Gulf of Mexico, net negative revisions were 8 million boe, including 2 million boe of negative price revisions. In Guyana, revisions increased proved developed reserves by 47 million boe related to performance (55%), improved recovery associated with water injection (35%), and increased natural gas for consumption (10%). In Malaysia and JDA, net revisions to proved developed reserves were an increase of 18 million boe due to performance at North Malay Basin and JDA (80%) and the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract at JDA (20%). Other had negative revisions to proved developed reserves of 4 million boe, primarily in Libya. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 97.2019: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net decrease of 107 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net decrease of 19 million boe (7 million barrels of NGL and 72 million mcf of natural gas). Revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken were a net decrease of 25 million boe with approximately 80% relating to changes in expected recoveries of NGL and natural gas and approximately 20% relating to the impact of lower prices. Net revisions from international assets were an increase of 6 million boe. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 97.2018: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net decrease of 41 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 3 million boe (4 million barrels of crude oil increase, 4 million barrels of NGL decrease and 20 million mcf of natural gas increase). Revisions to proved developed reserves primarily relate to the Bakken. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 97.Sales of minerals in place (‘Asset sales’)2020: Asset sales relate to the divestiture of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.2018: Asset sales primarily include our former interests in the Utica Basin of Ohio.Proved Undeveloped ReservesFollowing are the Corporation’s proved undeveloped reserves: UnitedStatesGuyanaMalaysia and JDAOther (a)Total (Millions of boe)Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 1, 2018337452423429Revisions of previous estimates(22)(3)(6)(13)(44)Extensions, discoveries and other additions178—1910207Transfers to proved developed reserves(97)——(2)(99)Sales of minerals in place(7)———(7)At December 31, 2018389423718486Revisions of previous estimates(91)9—(6)(88)Extensions, discoveries and other additions15434—15203Transfers to proved developed reserves(108)(29)(4)(2)(143)At December 31, 2019344563325458Revisions of previous estimates(146)42(4)(25)(133)Extensions, discoveries and other additions78502—130Transfers to proved developed reserves(85)(8)(7)—(100)Sales of minerals in place(3)———(3)At December 31, 202018814024—352(a)Other includes our interests in Denmark and Libya.Extensions, discoveries and other additions (‘Additions’)2020: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 78 million boe, which primarily resulted from new wells planned to be drilled in the next five years, including the impact of optimizing locations in the development plan. In Guyana, additions of 50 million boe were due to the sanction of the Payara project. In Malaysia, additions at the North Malay Basin were due to additional planned wells to be drilled. 962019: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 154 million boe, of which approximately 25% of the change results from additional planned wells to be drilled in the next five years, and approximately 75% results from new wells moved into the five-year plan associated with optimization of drilling locations. Additions in Guyana totaling 34 million boe are from the sanction of Phase 2 development at the Liza Field on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. Other additions were at the South Arne Field in Denmark and in Libya due to additional planned wells to be drilled.2018: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 168 million boe, of which approximately 40% of the change results from additional planned wells to be drilled in the next five years, approximately 35% results from performance associated with improved well completion designs, and approximately 25% results from other changes, primarily the impact of higher crude oil prices. Additions in the Gulf of Mexico were 10 million boe due to additional planned drilling at the Tubular Bells Field. Additions in Malaysia and JDA include 11 million boe at North Malay Basin and 8 million boe at the JDA relating to additional planned wells to be drilled within the next five years.Revisions of previous estimates2020: In the United States, negative reserve revisions of 146 million boe were from the Bakken, which included negative price revisions of 77 million boe, and a decrease of 121 million boe from wells moved outside our management and Board approved five-year plan due to a reduction in planned rig count and optimization of drilling locations in response to the decline in crude oil prices in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by positive revisions of 52 million boe, primarily due to optimized development spacing and increased well productivity. In Guyana, net positive reserve revisions for Liza Phase 1 and Phase 2 totaling 42 million boe resulted from improved recovery associated with water injection (45%), the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract (40%) and increased natural gas for consumption (15%). For Other, net negative reserves revisions were 14 million boe in Libya and 11 million boe in Denmark due to moving planned wells outside our five-year plan in response to the decline in crude oil prices in 2020.2019: Negative reserve revisions in the United States of 91 million boe were largely from the Bakken (94 million boe), of which approximately 75% resulted from wells moved outside our five-year plan associated with optimization of drilling locations. The remaining 25% of negative revisions in the Bakken were caused by lower commodity prices. The net positive reserve revisions in Guyana of 9 million boe relate to the Liza Phase 1 development due to the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing agreement.2018: Negative reserve revisions in the United States totaling 22 million boe, primarily resulted from optimizing drilling plans at the Bakken. Negative reserve revisions in international assets primarily resulted from updates in drilling plans in Denmark and North Malay Basin, and the impact of crude oil price changes on our production sharing agreement in Guyana.Transfers to proved developed reserves (‘Transfers’)2020: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves resulting from drilling activity included 83 million boe in the Bakken, 2 million boe in the Gulf of Mexico, 8 million boe for Liza Phase 1 in Guyana, and 7 million boe in the North Malay Basin.2019: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 100 million boe in the Bakken associated with drilling activity, 29 million boe at the Stabroek Block in Guyana where first production was achieved in 2019, and 8 million boe at the Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico associated with drilling activity.2018: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 75 million boe in the Bakken associated with drilling activity, and 22 million boe at the Stampede Field in the Gulf of Mexico where first production was achieved in 2018.In 2020, capital expenditures of $1,090 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (2019: $1,750 million; 2018: $1,070 million).At December 31, 2020, projects that have proved reserves that have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess of five years totaled 4.7 million boe, or less than 1% of total proved reserves, primarily related to the multi-phase development at North Malay Basin, offshore Malaysia.Production Sharing ContractsThe Corporation’s proved reserves include crude oil and natural gas reserves relating to long‑term agreements with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the legal right to produce or has a revenue interest in the production. The Corporation's operations with these production sharing arrangements include those in Guyana, Malaysia, and the JDA. Proved reserves for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, as well as volumes produced and received during 2020, 2019 and 2018 from these production sharing contracts are presented in the proved reserve tables on pages 94 and 95. Revisions resulting from the entitlement impact of price changes in production sharing contracts increased proved reserves by 22 million boe in 2020 (2019: 5 million boe increase; 2018: 7 million boe decrease). 97Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas ReservesFuture net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining year‑end reserve estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development and production costs, which are based on year‑end costs and existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year‑end statutory tax rates to the pre‑tax net cash flows, as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%.The prices used for the discounted future net cash flows in 2020 were $39.77 per barrel for WTI (2019: $55.73; 2018: $65.55) and $43.43 per barrel for Brent (2019: $62.54; 2018: $72.08) and do not include the effects of commodity hedges. NYMEX natural gas prices used were $2.16 per mcf in 2020 (2019: $2.54; 2018: $3.01). Selling prices have in the past, and can in the future, fluctuate significantly. As a result, selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices. In addition, the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The amount of tax deductions, credits, and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves, variances in actual pre-tax cash flows from forecasted pre-tax cash flows in historical periods, and the impact to year-end carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the Corporation’s income tax returns exploration expenses, interest expense, and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not contemplated in the standardized measure computations. The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used.At December 31TotalUnitedStatesGuyanaMalaysia and JDAOther (a) (In millions)2020 Future revenues$28,745 $11,757 $8,362 $2,578 $6,048 Less:Future production costs12,360 6,887 2,784 1,073 1,616 Future development costs6,322 2,593 2,617 677 435 Future income tax expenses4,135 45 380 110 3,600 22,817 9,525 5,781 1,860 5,651 Future net cash flows5,928 2,232 2,581 718 397 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate2,343 1,205 935 123 80 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$3,585 $1,027 $1,646 $595 $317 2019Future revenues$44,778 $25,223 $5,326 $3,473 $10,756 Less:Future production costs14,176 10,189 931 1,238 1,818 Future development costs8,267 5,104 1,549 823 791 Future income tax expenses8,560 1,291 505 162 6,602 31,003 16,584 2,985 2,223 9,211 Future net cash flows13,775 8,639 2,341 1,250 1,545 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate5,390 3,872 539 270 709 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$8,385 $4,767 $1,802 $980 $836 2018Future revenues$50,948 $31,460 $2,826 $4,443 $12,219 Less:Future production costs13,636 9,718 605 1,324 1,989 Future development costs8,427 6,132 596 949 750 Future income tax expenses10,950 2,641 334 233 7,742 33,013 18,491 1,535 2,506 10,481 Future net cash flows17,935 12,969 1,291 1,937 1,738 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate7,285 5,437 553 492 803 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$10,650 $7,532 $738 $1,445 $935 (a)Other includes our interests in Denmark and Libya. 98Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas ReservesFor the Years Ended December 31202020192018 (In millions)Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at January 1$8,385 $10,650 $6,356 Changes during the year:Sales and transfers of oil and gas produced during the year, net of production costs(1,829)(2,842)(2,755)Development costs incurred during the year1,479 2,262 1,533 Net changes in prices and production costs(10,141)(5,761)7,076 Net change in estimated future development costs1,860 (186)(1,119)Extensions and discoveries (including improved recovery) of oil and gas reserves, less related costs543 1,591 2,129 Revisions of previous oil and gas reserve estimates364 (281)(630)Net purchases (sales) of minerals in place, before income taxes(500)— (83)Accretion of discount1,220 1,635 929 Net change in income taxes2,091 1,305 (2,662)Revision in rate or timing of future production and other changes113 12 (124)Total(4,800)(2,265)4,294 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at December 31$3,585 $8,385 $10,650 99Item 9.

4447,HES,HESS CORP,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Catastrophic and other events, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may materially affect our operations and financial condition. Our oil and gas operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry, including catastrophic events, which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations, result in personal injury 20and have other significant adverse effects. These events include unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations, equipment malfunctions or failures, derailments, fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, hurricanes, severe weather, geological events, shortages in availability of skilled labor, cyber-attacks or health measures related to COVID-19. We maintain insurance coverage against many, but not all, potential losses and liabilities in amounts we deem prudent, including for property and casualty losses. There can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. For example, we are self-insured against physical damage to property and liability related to windstorms. In 2021 and 2020, hurricane-related downtime reduced net production by 4,000 boepd and 8,000 boepd, respectively, and hurricane related maintenance and repair costs were approximately $7 million in both 2021 and 2020. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. In addition, the frequency and severity of weather conditions which impact our business activities may also be impacted by the effects of climate change. Energy needs could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of any such climate change. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in order to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences. As part of our business, we are involved in large development projects, the completion of which may be delayed beyond what was originally planned. Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory or other government agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel, construction delays, unfavorable weather conditions, equipment failures, and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows.An inability to secure personnel, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and other required services or to retain key employees may result in material negative economic consequences. We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor. The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry. As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost, including as a result of changes to our industry due to COVID-19, which may impact our ability to run our operations and deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences. In addition, difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals. Our future success also depends upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team, who play an important role in developing and implementing our strategy. An inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations or the loss or departure of key members of senior management may prevent us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, which could negatively impact our business.Disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the Corporation or our business partners may materially impact our business and operations. Computers and telecommunication systems are an integral part of our exploration, development and production activities and the activities of our business partners. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our corporation and with outside business partners. Our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of remote communications and other work-from-home practices in response to COVID-19. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems or those of our business partners and result in disruptions to our business operations or the access, disclosure or loss of our data and proprietary information. In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. As a result, any such disruption, failure or cyber breach and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, financial loss, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.21Financial RisksWe have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms. The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involve substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations. Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. Although currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, a ratings downgrade, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms. In addition, a ratings downgrade may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements. Environmental concerns and other factors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices and may increase our costs to access the equity capital markets. Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy.We engage in risk management transactions designed to mitigate commodity price volatility and other risks that may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons. We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines. These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of additional hedges involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases. As with accounts receivable from the sale of hydrocarbons, we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement. In addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility.The alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs. Certain borrowings on our credit facilities may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures are expected to cause LIBOR to be discontinued after June 30, 2023 or to perform differently than in the past. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has proposed SOFR as an alternative to LIBOR. At this time, the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include fluctuations in interest rates or an increase in the cost of our credit facility borrowings.Regulatory, Legal and Environmental RisksOur oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages and other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us. Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases. These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations, solvency of subsequent owners and partners and other uncertainties.Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost.Climate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change and sustainability is a growing global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change and sustainability has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions. These agreements and measures may require, or could result in future legislation and regulatory measures that require, significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of GHGs from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, our production is sold to third parties that produce petroleum fuels, which through normal end user consumption result in the emission of GHGs. We are prioritizing sustainable energy practices to further reduce our carbon footprint while at the same time remaining a successful operating public company. However, various key stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, suppliers, customers, local communities and others, may have differing approaches to climate change initiatives. If we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode our stakeholders' trust and thereby affect our reputation. As a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives 22to reduce the use of petroleum fuels, demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced, which may have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins. The imposition and enforcement of stringent GHG emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business. Shareholder activism has been recently increasing in our industry, and stockholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. In addition, certain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change, which could make it more difficult to finance our business. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities, require us to incur increased costs, and/or result in reputational harm.We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Political or regulatory developments and governmental actions, including federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and those of our counterparties with whom we have contracted, which may affect our financial results. These actions could result in tax increases retroactively through tax claims or prospectively through changes to applicable statutory tax rates, modification of the tax base, or imposition of new tax types. Additionally, governmental actions could include post-production deductions from royalty payments; limitations or prohibitions on the sales of new oil and gas leases or extensions on existing oil and gas leases; adverse court decisions with respect to the sale of new and existing oil and gas leases; expropriation or nationalization of property; mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights; imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds; changes in import and export regulations; the imposition of tariffs; and anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws. In recent years, proposals for limitations on access to oil and gas exploration and development opportunities and related litigation have grown in certain areas and may include efforts to reduce access to public and private lands; restriction of exploration and production activities within government-owned and other lands; delaying or canceling permits for drilling or pipeline construction; restrictions or changes to existing pipeline easements; limiting or banning industry techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and/or adding restrictions on the use of water and associated disposal; imposition of set-backs on oil and gas sites; reduction of sulfur content in bunker fuel; delaying or denying air-quality or siting permits; advocating for increased regulations, punitive taxation, or citizen ballot initiatives or moratoriums on industry activity; and the use of social media channels to cause reputational harm. Costs associated with responding to these anti-development efforts or complying with any new legal or regulatory requirements could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate are politically less stable than other areas and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, corruption, security risks and labor unrest. Political instability and civil unrest in North Africa, South America and the Middle East has affected and may continue to affect our interests in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. In addition, geographic territorial border disputes may affect our business in certain areas, such as the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over a portion of the Stabroek Block. Political instability exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in obtaining required permits and government approvals, enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and potential adverse actions by local government authorities. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to our operations and the operations of the oil and gas industry in general.One of our subsidiaries is the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, Hess Midstream LP. The responsibilities associated with being a general partner expose us to a broader range of legal liabilities. Our control of Hess Midstream LP bestows upon us additional duties and obligations including, but not limited to, the obligations associated with managing potential conflicts of interests and additional reporting requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission. These heightened duties expose us to additional potential for legal claims that may have a material negative economic impact on our stockholders. Moreover, these increased duties may lead to an increase in compliance costs.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.23Item 3. Legal ProceedingsWe are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages.We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are two remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit, filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants.In September 2003, we received a directive from the NJDEP to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and agreed with the EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a ROD in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a final remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages.In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. The remedy selected by the EPA includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. The EPA’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA’s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us, and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design.From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. Beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. These proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Beginning in 2013, various parishes in Louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies, including us, alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused 24contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, the payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. The ultimate impact of such climate and other aforementioned environmental proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates.In August 2020, Fieldwood and related entities filed for bankruptcy relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Fieldwood’s Bankruptcy Plan, which was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in June 2021, includes the abandonment of certain assets, including seven offshore Gulf of Mexico leases and related facilities in the West Delta Field that were formerly owned by us and sold to a Fieldwood predecessor in 2004, and the discharge of Fieldwood’s obligation to decommission these facilities. As a result, in October 2021 and February 2022, we received decommissioning orders from the BSEE requiring us to decommission certain wells and related facilities located on six of the seven West Delta leases. We expect to receive additional orders covering the remainder of the West Delta decommissioning obligations in the near future and are actively engaged with the BSEE to agree on the scope and timing of decommissioning activities. Our decommissioning obligation derives from our former ownership of the facilities. We are seeking contribution from other parties that owned an interest in the facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we have a liability of $147 million representing total estimated abandonment obligations in the West Delta Field. Potential recoveries from other parties that previously owned an interest in the West Delta Field have not been recognized as of December 31, 2021.We are also involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings from time to time in addition to the matters described above, including claims related to post-production deductions from royalty payments. We may also be exposed to future decommissioning liabilities for divested assets in the event the current or future owners of facilities previously owned by us are determined to be unable to perform such actions, whether due to bankruptcy or otherwise. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding.Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.Item 4.

We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we and our partners have discovered a significant resource base and are executing a multi-phased development of the Block. The Liza Phase 1 development achieved first production in December 2019, and has a nameplate production capacity of approximately 120,000 gross bopd. The Liza Phase 2 development achieved first production in February 2022, and is expected to reach its production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd later in 2022 as operations are safely brought online. A third development, Payara, was sanctioned in the third quarter of 2020 and is expected to achieve first production in 2024, with production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd. A fourth development, Yellowtail, was submitted to the government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter of 2021. Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the project is expected to have a capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd with first production anticipated in 2025. We currently plan to have six FPSOs with an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1 million gross bopd on the Stabroek Block in 2027, and the potential for up to ten FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base.Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s approximate 43.5% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2021, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota.Climate Change, Energy Transition and Our StrategyWe believe climate risks can and should be addressed while at the same time providing safe, affordable and reliable energy necessary to ensure human welfare and global economic development in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The IEA's 2021 World Energy Outlook provides four scenarios of global energy demand in 2040 based on varying levels of global response to climate change. Under all of the IEA scenarios, oil and natural gas are expected to be needed for decades to come and we expect that significant investment will be required to meet the world’s projected growing energy needs, both in renewable energy sources and in oil and gas.Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. Our strategy aligns with the energy transition needed to achieve the IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario, which reflects the major changes that would be required to reach the energy-related Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.Our commitment to sustainability starts with our Board of Directors and senior management and is reinforced throughout our organization. Our Board of Directors, led by its Environmental, Health and Safety Committee, is actively engaged in overseeing Hess’ sustainability practices so that sustainability risks and opportunities are taken into account when making strategic decisions. Our Board’s Compensation and Management Development Committee has tied executive compensation to advancing our environmental, health and safety goals. We also have an executive led task force to consider our medium and longer term climate strategy.28In 2021, we announced our new five year GHG reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 52% from 2017. In January 2022, we announced our plan to reduce routine flaring at Hess operated assets to zero by the end of 2025. Our business planning includes actions we expect to undertake to continue reducing our carbon footprint consistent with our targets. We also conduct annual scenario planning as a methodology to assess our portfolio’s resilience to differing scenarios of energy supply and demand over the longer term, and to inform our understanding of future risks and opportunities in relation to the potential evolution of energy demand, energy mix, the emergence of new technologies, and possible changes by policymakers with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.2022 Outlook Following the startup of the Liza Phase 2 project in February 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding under our $1 billion term loan and we announced a 50 percent increase in our quarterly dividend on common stock. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are projected to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2022. Capital investment for our Midstream operations is expected to be approximately $235 million. Oil and gas net production in 2022 is forecast to be in the range of 325,000 boepd to 330,000 boepd excluding Libya. For 2022, we have hedged 90,000 bopd with WTI collars with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $100 per barrel, and 60,000 bopd with Brent collars with an average monthly floor price of $65 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $105 per barrel.Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,890 million in 2021, compared with $1,333 million in 2020, while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2,991 million in 2021 and $1,803 million in 2020. In 2022, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program, dividends, and the recent repayment of the remaining $500 million outstanding under our $1 billion term loan. Depending on market conditions, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays, including dividends, pursue asset sales, borrow against our committed revolving credit facility, or issue debt or equity securities.Consolidated ResultsNet income attributable to Hess Corporation was $559 million in 2021 compared with a net loss of $3,093 million in 2020. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 32, adjusted net income was $677 million in 2021 compared with an adjusted net loss of $894 million in 2020. Annual net production averaged 315,000 boepd and 331,000 boepd in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total proved reserves were 1,309 million boe and 1,170 million boe at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.Significant 2021 ActivitiesThe following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2021:E&P assets:•In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken shale play averaged 156,000 boepd in 2021 (2020: 193,000 boepd), primarily due to the impact of lower drilling activity caused by a reduction in rig count from six to one during the first half of 2020, lower NGL and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts, curtailed production related to the planned Tioga Gas Plant maintenance turnaround completed in the third quarter of 2021, and the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interests in the second quarter of 2021, which contributed net production of 2,000 boepd in 2021 (2020: 6,000 boepd). Net oil production was 80,000 bopd in 2021 compared with 107,000 bopd in 2020. NGL and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts were 11,000 boepd in 2021 compared with 21,000 boepd in 2020 as higher realized NGL prices in 2021 reduced the volumes received as consideration for gas processing fees. Prior to COVID-19, we were operating six rigs in the Bakken, but reduced the rig count to one in May 2020 in response to the sharp decline in crude oil prices. We added a second operated rig in the Bakken in February 2021 and a third operated rig in September 2021. We drilled 63 wells and brought 51 wells on production in 2021, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,599 at December 31, 2021. We forecast net production from the Bakken to be in the range of 160,000 boepd to 165,000 boepd in 2022.•In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 45,000 boepd in 2021 (2020: 56,000 boepd) primarily due to the sale of the Shenzi Field in November 2020. Net production from the Shenzi Field was 9,000 boepd in 2020.•At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, net production from the Liza Phase 1 development averaged 30,000 bopd in 2021 (2020: 20,000 bopd) following first production in December 2019 from the Liza Destiny FPSO. The Liza 29Destiny has a nameplate production capacity of approximately 120,000 gross bopd and in 2022 its production capacity is expected to increase to more than 140,000 gross bopd following production optimization work.The Liza Phase 2 development, which was sanctioned in 2019, began producing oil in February 2022 from the Liza Unity FPSO. The Liza Unity is expected to reach its production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd later in 2022 as operations are safely brought online. For 2022, net production from Guyana is expected to be in the range of 65,000 bopd to 70,000 bopd, reflecting the ramp in production during the year from Liza Phase 2.The Payara Field development was sanctioned in 2020 and will utilize the Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected in 2024. Ten drill centers with a total of 41 wells are planned, including 20 production wells and 21 injection wells.A fourth development, Yellowtail, was submitted to the government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter of 2021. Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the project is expected to have a capacity of 250,000 gross bopd with first production anticipated in 2025.In addition to the first four developments, planning is underway for additional FPSOs. The ultimate sizing and order of these potential developments will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling.In 2021, four successful exploration wells and seven successful appraisal wells were drilled on the Stabroek Block. For 2022, the operator plans to operate six drillships and drill approximately 12 exploration and appraisal wells during the year.•In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A‑18 of the JDA averaged 36,000 boepd in 2021 (2020: 29,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, while net production from North Malay Basin averaged 25,000 boepd in 2021 (2020: 23,000 boepd). During 2021, we continued the drilling program at North Malay Basin, and we commenced a multi-year drilling program at JDA in the first half of the year.•We completed the sale of our interests in Denmark in August for net cash consideration of approximately $130 million, after normal closing adjustments. Net production from Denmark was 3,000 boepd in 2021.The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2021:•In March 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public offering of 6.9 million Class A shares held by Hess and GIP.

The incremental gas processing capacity was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2021 following completion of a planned maintenance turnaround which included connecting the expansion and residue NGL takeaway pipelines to the plant. The total processing capacity of 400 mmcfd became available in February 2022.30Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory ExpendituresAt December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $2,713 million (2020: $1,739 million), consolidated debt was $8,458 million (2020: $8,296 million), and our debt to capitalization ratio (as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement) was 42.3% (2020: 47.5%). Hess Midstream debt, which is nonrecourse to Hess Corporation, was $2,564 million at December 31, 2021 (2020: $1,910 million).Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions): 202120202019E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures: United States North Dakota$522 $661 $1,312 Offshore and other103 258 471 Total United States625 919 1,783 Guyana1,016 743 783 Malaysia and JDA154 99 109 Other (a)34 25 68 E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures$1,829 $1,786 $2,743 Exploration Expenses Charged to Income Included Above: United States$90 $91 $105 International41 17 62 Total Exploration Expenses Charged to Income included above$131 $108 $167 Midstream Capital Expenditures: Midstream Capital Expenditures (b)$183 $253 $416 (a)Other includes our interests in Denmark (which were sold in August 2021), Libya and certain non-producing countries.(b)Excludes equity investments of $33 million in 2019.In 2022, we project our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.6 billion and Midstream capital expenditures to be approximately $235 million.Consolidated Results of OperationsResults by Segment:The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 202120202019 (In millions, except per share amounts)Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation: Exploration and Production$770 $(2,841)$53 Midstream286 230 144 Corporate, Interest and Other(497)(482)(605)Total$559 $(3,093)$(408)Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Per Common Share - Diluted (a)$1.81 $(10.15)$(1.37)(a)Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation less preferred stock dividends, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares.In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.31Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods:The following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods.

Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations.Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and 32liabilities to evaluate the Corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods.These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.Comparison of ResultsExploration and ProductionFollowing is a summarized statement of income for our E&P operations: 202120202019 (In millions)Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues$7,473 $4,667 $6,495 Gains on asset sales, net29 79 22 Other, net64 31 51 Total revenues and non-operating income7,566 4,777 6,568 Costs and Expenses Marketing, including purchased oil and gas2,119 1,067 1,849 Operating costs and expenses965 895 971 Production and severance taxes172 124 184 Midstream tariffs1,094 946 722 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment162 351 233 General and administrative expenses191 206 204 Depreciation, depletion and amortization1,361 1,915 1,977 Impairment and other147 2,126 — Total costs and expenses6,211 7,630 6,140 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes1,355 (2,853)428 Provision (benefit) for income taxes585 (12)375 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$770 $(2,841)$53 Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 37, the changes in E&P results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, Midstream tariffs, DD&A expense, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below.33Selling Prices: Average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 36% higher in 2021 compared with the prior year, primarily due to the increase in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for NGL increased in 2021 by 174% and worldwide natural gas prices increased in 2021 by 54%, compared with the prior year. In total, higher realized selling prices improved after-tax results by approximately $1,430 million, compared with 2020. Our average selling prices were as follows: 202120202019Average Selling Prices (a)Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Including Hedging) United States North Dakota$55.57 $42.63 $53.19 Offshore60.09 45.92 59.18 Total United States56.64 43.56 55.15 Guyana68.57 46.41 — Malaysia and JDA71.00 37.91 61.81 Other (b)66.39 51.37 65.22 Worldwide60.08 44.28 56.77 Crude Oil - Per Barrel (Excluding Hedging) United States North Dakota$59.90 $33.87 $53.18 Offshore64.77 36.55 59.17 Total United States61.05 34.63 55.14 Guyana71.07 37.40 — Malaysia and JDA71.00 37.91 61.81 Other (b)69.25 43.42 65.22 Worldwide63.90 35.52 56.76 Natural Gas Liquids - Per Barrel United States North Dakota$30.74 $11.29 $13.20 Offshore26.40 8.94 13.31 Worldwide30.40 11.10 13.21 Natural Gas - Per Mcf United States North Dakota$4.08 $1.27 $1.59 Offshore3.25 1.23 2.12 Total United States3.82 1.26 1.83 Malaysia and JDA5.15 4.47 5.04 Other (b)3.40 3.41 4.63 Worldwide4.60 2.98 3.90 (a)Selling prices in the United States are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in Marketing expenses.

For calendar year 2022, we have WTI collars with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $100 per barrel for 90,000 bopd, and Brent collars with an average monthly floor price of $65 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $105 per barrel for 60,000 bopd. We expect premium amortization, which will be reflected in realized selling prices, to reduce our 2022 results by approximately $225 million.34Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 202120202019 (In thousands)Crude Oil - Barrels United States North Dakota80 107 94 Offshore (a)29 38 46 Total United States109 145 140 Guyana30 20 — Malaysia and JDA3 4 4 Other (b)21 9 25 Total163 178 169 Natural Gas Liquids - Barrels United States North Dakota49 56 42 Offshore (a)4 5 5 Total United States53 61 47 Natural Gas - Mcf United States North Dakota162 180 110 Offshore (a)72 76 91 Total United States234 256 201 Malaysia and JDA347 291 351 Other (b)10 7 20 Total591 554 572 Barrels of Oil Equivalent315 331 311 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production69 %72 %69 %(a)In November 2020, we sold our working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production from the Shenzi Field was 9,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019: 12,000 boepd).(b)Other includes our interests in Denmark, which were sold in August 2021, and Libya. Net production from Denmark was 3,000 boepd for 2021 (2020: 6,000 boepd; 2019: 7,000 boepd). Net production from Libya was 20,000 boepd for 2021 (2020: 4,000 boepd; 2019: 21,000 boepd). In 2022, we expect net production, excluding Libya, to be in the range of 325,000 boepd to 330,000 boepd, compared with 2021 net production, excluding Libya and assets sold, of 290,000 boepd.Net production variances related to 2021 and 2020 are summarized as follows:United States: North Dakota net production was lower in 2021, primarily due to the impact of lower drilling activity caused by a reduction in rig count from six to one during the first half of 2020, lower NGL and natural gas volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts due to higher commodity prices, curtailed production related to the planned Tioga Gas Plant maintenance turnaround completed in the third quarter of 2021, and the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interests in the second quarter of 2021. Total offshore net production was lower in 2021 primarily due to the sale of the Shenzi Field in November 2020.International: Net crude oil production from Guyana was higher in 2021, due to the production ramp up from the Liza Phase 1 development in 2020. Net oil production in Libya was higher in 2021 due to force majeure declared on production operations between January 2020 and October 2020. Net natural gas production was higher at Malaysia and JDA reflecting higher natural gas nominations due to a recovery in economic activity which had been impacted by COVID-19.35Sales Volumes: Net worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, which excludes sales volumes of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas purchased from third parties, were as follows: 202120202019 (In thousands)Crude oil – barrels (a)63,540 60,924 61,061 Natural gas liquids – barrels19,406 22,397 17,067 Natural gas – mcf215,589 202,917 208,665 Barrels of Oil Equivalent118,878 117,141 112,906 Crude oil - barrels per day174 167 167 Natural gas liquids - barrels per day53 61 47 Natural gas - mcf per day591 554 572 Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day326 320 309 (a)At December 31, 2020, we had 4.2 million barrels of crude oil transported and stored on two chartered VLCCs for sale in Asian markets. The two VLCC cargos were sold in the first quarter of 2021.Marketing, including purchased oil and gas (Marketing expense): Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, primarily in the U.S., and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. marketing activities. Marketing expense was higher in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher third party crude oil volumes purchased and prices paid for purchased volumes. Marketing expenses in 2021 included $173 million related to the cost of 4.2 million barrels of crude oil stored on two VLCCs in 2020 that were sold in 2021. Marketing expense in 2020 was reduced by $164 million for the net cost of crude oil inventory that was capitalized for the barrels loaded on VLCCs.Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs consist of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses. Excluding items affecting comparability described in Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods on page 37, cash operating costs increased primarily due to higher maintenance and workover activity in 2021 compared with the prior year due to reduced activity in 2020 related to COVID-19, and higher production and severance taxes associated with higher crude oil prices in 2021. On a per-unit basis, cash operating costs were higher in 2021 due to the higher costs and the impact of lower 2021 production volumes.Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense increased from 2020, primarily due to higher tariff rates and minimum volume commitments in 2021. In 2022, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $1,190 million to $1,215 million.DD&A Expense: DD&A expense was lower in 2021 primarily due to the impact to DD&A rates resulting from year-end 2020 revisions and additions to proved reserves, lower production volumes in 2021, and the impact of impairment charges recognized in the first quarter of 2020.Unit Costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P net production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed on page 37. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: ActualForecast range (a) 2021202020192022Cash operating costs (b)$11.55 $9.91 $11.99 $12.50 — $13.00DD&A expense (c)11.84 15.80 17.43 $11.50 — $12.50Total Production Unit Costs$23.39 $25.71 $29.42 $24.00 — $25.50(a)Forecast information excludes any contribution from Libya.(b)Cash operating costs per boe, excluding Libya, were $12.11 in 2021 (2020: $9.85; 2019: $12.54). (c)DD&A expense per boe, excluding Libya, was $12.43 in 2021 (2020: $15.98; 2019: $18.52).36Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows:202120202019 (In millions)Exploratory dry hole costs (a)$11 $192 $49 Exploration lease and other impairment (b)20 51 17 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead131 108 167 $162 $351 $233 (a)In 2021, dry hole costs primarily related to the Koebi-1 well in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In 2020, dry hole costs primarily related to the Tanager-1 well in the Kaieteur Block, offshore Guyana, the Galapagos Deep and Oldfield-1 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and the write-off of previously capitalized exploratory wells (see Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below).(b)In 2020, exploration lease and other impairment included impaired leasehold costs due to a reprioritization of the Corporation’s forward capital program (see Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below).In 2022, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million.Income Taxes: In 2021, income tax expense was $585 million compared with an income tax benefit of $12 million in 2020, primarily due to higher pre-tax income in Libya and Guyana. Income tax expense from Libya operations was $436 million in 2021 compared with $38 million in 2020. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S. (non-Midstream), Denmark (sold in August 2021), and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards.

In June 2021, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved Fieldwood’s bankruptcy plan which included discharging decommissioning obligations, subject to conditions precedent, for certain of Fieldwood’s assets. Those obligations will transfer to former owners of the properties, including us with respect to the West Delta Field, which we sold in 2004. Potential recoveries from other parties that previously owned an interest in the West Delta Field have not been recognized as of December 31, 2021. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.2020:•Impairment and other: We recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $2.1 billion ($2.0 billion after income taxes) related to our oil and gas properties at North Malay Basin in Malaysia, the South Arne Field in Denmark, and the Stampede and Tubular Bells fields in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. Other charges totaling $21 million pre-tax ($20 million after income taxes) related to drilling rig right-of-use assets in the Bakken and surplus materials and supplies. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Dry hole and lease impairment expenses: We incurred pre-tax charges totaling $152 million ($150 million after income taxes) in the first quarter to write-off previously capitalized exploratory well costs of $125 million ($123 million after income taxes) primarily related to the northern portion of the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico and to impair certain exploration leasehold costs by $27 million ($27 million after income taxes) due to a reprioritization of our capital program.•Crude oil inventories write-down: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $53 million ($52 million after income taxes) to adjust crude oil inventories to their net realizable value at the end of the first quarter following the significant decline in crude oil prices.•Severance costs: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $26 million ($26 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits incurred related to cost reduction initiatives.•Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $79 million ($79 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.2019:•Cost recovery settlement: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $21 million ($19 million after income taxes) related to a settlement on historical cost recovery balances in the JDA that was paid in cash.•Reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowance: We recorded a noncash income tax benefit of $60 million, which resulted from the reversal of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in Guyana upon achieving first production from the Liza Phase 1 development.•Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our remaining acreage in the Utica shale play.38MidstreamFollowing is a summarized statement of income for our Midstream operations: 202120202019 (In millions)Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues$1,204 $1,092 $848 Other, net10 10 4 Total revenues and non-operating income1,214 1,102 852 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses289 338 279 General and administrative expenses22 21 56 Depreciation, depletion and amortization166 157 142 Interest expense105 95 63 Total costs and expenses582 611 540 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes632 491 312 Provision (benefit) for income taxes15 7 — Net income (loss)617 484 312 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests331 254 168 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$286 $230 $144 Sales and other operating revenues increased from 2020 primarily due to higher tariff rates and minimum volume commitments partially offset by lower pass-through rail transportation revenue. Operating costs and expenses decreased from 2020 primarily due to lower pass-through transportation costs, which were partially offset by the costs incurred associated with the planned Tioga Gas Plant maintenance turnaround in 2021. DD&A expense increased from 2020 primarily due to additional assets placed in service. Interest expense increased from 2020 primarily due to the $750 million of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 issued in August 2021.In 2022, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $275 million to $285 million.Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: In 2019, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($16 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interests) in General and Administrative Expenses for transaction related costs for Hess Midstream Partners LP’s acquisition of HIP and the associated corporate restructuring. See Note 4, Hess Midstream LP in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate, Interest and OtherThe following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 202120202019 (In millions)Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability)$121 $114 $114 Interest expense376 373 355 Less: Capitalized interest— — (38)Interest expense, net376 373 317 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes497 487 431 Provision (benefit) for income taxes— (6)— Net Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes497 481 431 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after income taxes— 1 174 Total Corporate, Interest and Other Expenses After Income Taxes$497 $482 $605 Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a gain from the sale of a property related to a former downstream business in 2020. In 2022, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. Interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million in 2022.39Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense):2020:•Severance costs: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $1 million ($1 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits related to cost reduction initiatives.2019:•Pension settlement: We recorded a noncash pension settlement charge of $88 million ($88 million after income taxes) associated with the purchase of a single premium annuity contract by the Hess Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan to settle and transfer certain of its obligations to a third party. The charge is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.•Income tax: We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax expense of $86 million that was previously a component of accumulated other comprehensive income related to our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 20212020 (In millions, except ratio)Cash and cash equivalents (a)$2,713 $1,739 Current portion of long-term debt (b)517 10 Total debt (c)8,458 8,296 Total equity7,026 6,335 Debt to capitalization ratio for debt covenants (d)42.3 %47.5 %(a)Includes $2 million of cash attributable to our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2021 (2020: $4 million) of which, $2 million is held by Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2021 (2020: $3 million).(b)Includes the remaining $500 million outstanding under our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023 that we repaid in February 2022.(c)Includes $2,564 million of debt outstanding from our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2021 (2020: $1,910 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation.(d)Total Consolidated Debt of Hess Corporation (including finance leases and excluding Midstream non-recourse debt) as a percentage of Total Capitalization of Hess Corporation as defined under Hess Corporation's term loan and revolving credit facility financial covenants.

See Note 7, Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash FlowsThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 202120202019 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$2,890 $1,333 $1,642 Investing activities(1,325)(1,707)(2,843)Financing activities(591)568 52 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents$974 $194 $(1,149)Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,890 million in 2021 (2020: $1,333 million), while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2,991 million in 2021 (2020: $1,803 million). Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased from 2020 primarily due to higher realized selling prices. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by $101 million, primarily from higher receivables which includes premiums paid on crude oil hedge contracts, and abandonment expenditures, partially offset by accrued income taxes and royalties payable, an increase in accrued liabilities, and a decrease in crude oil inventory resulting from our VLCC transactions. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by $470 million, primarily from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, an increase in crude oil inventory resulting from our VLCC transactions, and abandonment expenditures, partially offset by lower receivables. At December 31, 2021, we have accrued income taxes and royalties payable of approximately $470 million in Libya related to operations for the period December 2020 through November 2021, which we paid in January 2022.Investing Activities: Total Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment were $1,747 million in 2021 (2020: $2,197 million). The decrease primarily reflects lower drilling activity. Proceeds from asset sales were $427 million in 2021 (2020: $493 million).40Financing Activities: In 2021, we repaid $500 million of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023. Borrowings in 2021 related to the $750 million of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 issued by our Midstream operating segment, while borrowings in 2020 related to our $1 billion term loan. Common stock dividends paid were $311 million in 2021 (2020: $309 million), and payments to noncontrolling interests were $664 million in 2021 (2020: $261 million), which included $375 million paid to GIP for the repurchase by HESM Opco of approximately 15.6 million GIP-owned Class B units. In 2021, we received net proceeds of $178 million from two public offerings totaling approximately 7.8 million Hess-owned Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP.Future Capital Requirements and ResourcesAt December 31, 2021, we had $2.71 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $6.3 billion. Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion committed revolving credit facility matures in May 2024. In January 2022, we paid accrued Libyan income tax and royalties of approximately $470 million related to operations for the period December 2020 through November 2021. In February 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding under our $1 billion term loan.Net production in 2022 is forecast to be in the range of 325,000 boepd to 330,000 boepd, excluding Libya, and we expect our 2022 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $2.6 billion. For calendar year 2022, we have WTI collars with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $100 per barrel for 90,000 bopd, and Brent collars with an average monthly floor price of $65 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $105 per barrel for 60,000 bopd.In 2022, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program, dividends, and the recent repayment of the remaining $500 million outstanding under our $1 billion term loan. Depending on market conditions, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays, including dividends, pursue asset sales, borrow against our committed revolving credit facility, or issue debt or equity securities.The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2021:ExpirationDateCapacityBorrowingsLetters ofCreditIssuedTotalUsedAvailableCapacity (In millions)Hess Corporation Revolving credit facilityMay 2024$3,500 $— $— $— $3,500 Committed linesVarious (a)100 — 29 29 71 Uncommitted linesVarious (a)230 — 230 230 — Total - Hess Corporation $3,830 $— $259 $259 $3,571 Midstream Revolving credit facility (b)December 2024$1,000 $104 $— $104 $896 Total - Midstream $1,000 $104 $— $104 $896 (a)Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2022.(b)This credit facility may only be utilized by HESM Opco and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation.Hess Corporation:In April 2021, we amended the Corporation's fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility that had an expiration date in May 2023, by extending the facility for one year to May 2024 and incorporating customary provisions for the eventual replacement of LIBOR, among other changes as set forth in the amended credit agreement. This facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.40% above LIBOR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. At December 31, 2021, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under its revolving credit facility. In 2020, we entered into a $1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of March 16, 2023. Borrowings under the term loan generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an initial applicable margin of 2.25%. In July 2021, we repaid $500 million of the term loan, and in February 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million.The revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15% (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement). The indentures for the Corporation's fixed-rate public notes limit the ratio of 41secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15%. As of December 31, 2021, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants. The most restrictive of the financial covenants related to our fixed-rate public notes and our term loan and revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional $1,843 million of secured debt at December 31, 2021. For additional information regarding the alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR on our borrowing costs, see Financial Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors.We had $259 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2021 (2020: $269 million), which relate to our global business operations. We have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.Midstream:At December 31, 2021, HESM Opco, a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, had $1.4 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing December 16, 2024, consisting of a $1 billion five year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn $400 million five year term loan A facility. The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund HESM Opco’s operating activities, capital expenditures, distributions and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the five year term loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the five year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. HESM Opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2021. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of the assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2021, borrowings of $104 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $390 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s term loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation.Credit RatingsTwo of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating. In March 2021, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed our credit rating at BBB- and revised the outlook to stable (from negative). Fitch Ratings affirmed our BBB- credit rating and revised the outlook from stable to positive in August 2021 and Moody’s Investors Service affirmed our credit rating at Ba1, which is below investment grade, and revised the outlook from stable to positive in November 2021.At December 31, 2021, HESM Opco’s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, and Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service.Cash Requirements: Our cash obligations and commitments over the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt, interest, lease payments, and purchase obligations which cover a portion of our planned capital expenditure program in 2022 and include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, transportation and related contracts, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses.Our long-term cash obligations and commitments include:•Debt and interest: See Note 7, Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. •Operating and finance leases: The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, equipment, logistical assets (offshore vessels, aircraft, and shorebases), and office space for varying periods. See Note 6, Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Purchase obligations: We were contractually committed at December 31, 2021 for certain long-term capital expenditures and operating expenses. Long-term obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, transportation and related contracts, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. See Note 18, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Asset retirement obligations: See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.42•Post-retirement plan liabilities: We have certain unfunded post-retirement plans, including our post-retirement medical plan. See Note 9, Retirement Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Uncertain income tax positions: See Note 15, Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAt December 31, 2021, we had $259 million in letters of credit. See also Note 18, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Foreign OperationsWe conduct E&P activities outside the U.S., principally in Guyana, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand, Malaysia, Libya, Suriname, and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, currency risk, corruption and acts of terrorism. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesAccounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E&P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets.For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year.Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2021 were $66.34 per barrel for WTI (2020: $39.77) and $68.92 per barrel for Brent (2020: $43.43). At December 31, 2021, spot prices closed at $75.21 per barrel for WTI and $77.02 per barrel for Brent. If crude oil prices in 2022 are at levels below that used in determining 2021 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2022 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2022 above those used in determining 2021 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2022. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2022, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2022 crude oil prices, the amount of any additions to proved reserves, positive or negative revisions in 43proved reserves related to 2022 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2022 crude oil prices, and management’s plans as of December 31, 2022 for developing proved undeveloped reserves. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021 would result in an approximate $165 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2022 based on projected production volumes. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 89 through 98 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves.Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements.In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.Our impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. We could experience an impairment in the future if one or a combination of the following occur: the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the economic slowdown from COVID-19, we reviewed our oil and gas fields and midstream operating segment asset groups for impairment at March 31, 2020. We impaired various oil and gas fields located in Malaysia, Denmark, and the Gulf of Mexico in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.Hess Midstream LP: We consolidate the activities of our interest in Hess Midstream LP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through Hess Corporation’s approximate 43.5% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered Hess Midstream LP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between Hess Midstream LP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of Hess Midstream LP.Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. Due to a sustained low commodity price environment, we remained in a three-year cumulative loss 44position, both on a consolidated basis and for certain jurisdictions, at December 31, 2021. A three-year cumulative loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S. (non-Midstream), Denmark (sold in August 2021), and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions.At December 31, 2021, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $3,838 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth. Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E&P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations.Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. The most significant assumptions relate to:Discount rates used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost: The discount rates used to estimate our projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. At December 31, 2021, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate assumptions would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately $130 million and would increase forecasted 2022 annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately $10 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligations would decrease the funded status of our pension plans, but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios.Expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets: The expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of plan assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. At December 31, 2021, a 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2022 annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately $10 million.Other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and expected participant mortality.Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.45Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for financial assets, and our credit is considered for financial liabilities.We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.Environment, Health and SafetyOur long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our EHS & SR policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives.Environmental MattersWe recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. The EPA has adopted a series of GHG monitoring, reporting, and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting further legislation to reduce GHG emissions. For example, in November 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The EPA is currently seeking public comments on its proposal, which the EPA hopes to finalize by the end of 2022. In addition, states have taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. At the international level, the Paris Agreement on climate change aimed to enhance global response to global temperature changes and to reduce GHG emissions, among other things. We are committed to complying with all GHG emissions regulations that apply to our operations, including those related to venting or flaring of natural gas, and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. While we monitor climate-related regulatory initiatives and international public policy issues, the current state of ongoing international climate initiatives and any related domestic actions make it difficult to assess the timing or effect on our operations or to predict with certainty the future costs that we may incur in order to comply with future international treaties, legislation or new regulations. However, future restrictions on emissions of GHGs, or related measures to encourage use of low carbon energy could result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products, as described under Regulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include E&P facilities, sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and, although not currently significant, EPA “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. For additional information, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. At December 31, 2021, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $60 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $16 million in 2021 (2020: $15 million; 2019: $20 million). The amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.As an element of our EHS and SR strategy, we purchase carbon credits annually to offset 100 percent of our estimated Scope 3 business travel emissions and 100 percent of our estimated Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions associated with operating the Corporation’s truck fleet, aviation activities (aircraft and helicopters) and personal and rental vehicle miles driven on company business. We also 46offset purchased electricity used in our operations from nonrenewable sources by purchasing renewable energy credits. The cost of purchased carbon and renewable energy credits was not material to our financial results in 2021 and was included in Operating costs and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.Health and Safety MattersThe crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels regarding the health and safety of E&P operations. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other matters, occupational safety, the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production, well control and integrity, process safety and equipment integrity, and may include permitting and disclosure requirements, operating restrictions and other conditions on the development of crude oil and natural gas. The level of our expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country health and safety regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. While compliance with laws and regulations relating to health and safety matters increases the overall cost of business for us and the oil and gas industry in general, it has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or results of operations. Occupational Safety: We are subject to the requirements set forth under federal workplace standards by the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. Under OSHA and other federal and state occupational safety and health laws and laws of foreign countries in which we operate, we must develop, maintain and disclose certain information about hazardous materials used, released, or produced in our operations. Production and Well Integrity: Our U.S. onshore production facilities are subject to U.S. federal government, state and local regulations regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing and well control and integrity. Our offshore production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico are subject to the U.S. federal government’s Safety and Environmental Management System regulations, which provide a systematic approach for identifying, managing and mitigating hazards. Adapting to new technical standards and procedures in production and in our well integrity management system is fundamental to our aim of protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce and the communities in which we operate, and to safeguarding our product.Process Safety and Equipment Integrity: We are also regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels regarding process safety and the integrity of our equipment, including OSHA’s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard. ICE are barriers and safeguards that prevent or mitigate process safety incidents through detection, isolation, containment, control or emergency preparedness and response within our facilities. We have established ICE performance standards, which set specific requirements and criteria for inspections and tests that help to ensure ICE barriers are effective. We conduct assessments collaboratively with our operated assets, subject matter experts and technical authorities to evaluate compliance with corporate and asset environment, health and safety standards and procedures, as well as with applicable regulations. For additional information on our emergency response and incident mitigation activities, see Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures in Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties. 47Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskIn the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities.Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options in our risk management activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them:•Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract.•Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Malaysian Ringgit, which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of those currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date.•Exchange-traded Contracts: We may use exchange-traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits.•Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange-traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and are exposed to the favorable consequence of collecting payment upon exercise depending upon the underlying commodity price movement. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and are exposed to the unfavorable consequence of having to make payment upon exercise depending upon the underlying commodity price movement.Financial Risk Management ActivitiesWe have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $145 million at December 31, 2021 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain or loss of approximately $5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021.At December 31, 2021, our total long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments, had a carrying value of $8,458 million and a fair value of $9,897 million. A 15% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately $390 million or $405 million, respectively. Any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixed-rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity.For calendar year 2022, we have WTI collars with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $100 per barrel for 90,000 bopd, and Brent collars with an average monthly floor price of $65 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $105 per barrel for 60,000 bopd. As of December 31, 2021, an assumed 10% increase in the forward WTI and Brent crude oil prices used in determining the fair value of our collars would reduce the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $100 million, while an assumed 10% decrease in the same crude oil prices would increase the fair value of these derivative instruments by approximately $100 million.See Note 20, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.48Item 8.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, as stated in their report, which is included herein.By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. RiellyExecutive Vice President andChief Financial Officer John B. HessChief Executive OfficerMarch 1, 202250Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and StockholdersHess CorporationOpinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPNew York, New YorkMarch 1, 202251Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and StockholdersHess CorporationOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and natural gas propertiesDescription of the Matter The net book value of the Corporation’s exploration and production assets was $11,047 million at December 31, 2021, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $1,361 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Corporation follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, DD&A expense is recorded using the units-of-production method, based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by petroleum engineering specialists, for property acquisition costs and proved developed oil and gas reserves, also estimated by petroleum engineering specialists, for oil and gas production facilities and wells. Proved oil and gas reserves are based on geological and engineering evaluations of estimated in-place hydrocarbon volumes using financial and non-financial inputs. Significant judgment is required by the Corporations’ internal engineering staff in evaluating the geological and engineering data used to estimate reserves. Estimating proved reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and natural gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. Management used independent petroleum engineering specialists to audit52 approximately 88% of the Corporation’s proved reserves at December 31, 2021 as prepared by the Corporation’s internal engineering staff.Auditing the Corporation’s DD&A expense calculation is complex because of our need to assess the reasonableness of management’s determination of the inputs described above used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves and to use the work of the internal engineering staff and independent petroleum engineering specialists.How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the DD&A expense calculation. This included controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves. Our testing of the Corporation’s DD&A expense calculation included, among other procedures, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Corporation’s internal petroleum engineering specialist responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s reserve estimates and of the independent petroleum engineering specialist used to audit the estimates. In addition, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing significant inputs to source documentation, where available, on a sample basis and assessing the inputs for reasonableness based on review of corroborative evidence and consideration of any contrary evidence. Additionally, we performed analytic and lookback procedures on inputs into the oil and gas reserve estimate as well as on the outputs. Finally, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the DD&A expense calculations, including comparing the proved oil and gas reserves to the Corporation’s reserve report. /s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have

Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting PoliciesUnless the context indicates otherwise, references to “Hess”, “the Corporation”, “Registrant”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the consolidated business operations of Hess Corporation and its affiliates.Nature of Business: Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global E&P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada.Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s approximate 43.5% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2021 (see Note 4, Hess Midstream LP) provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota.Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess Corporation and entities in which we own more than a 50% voting interest. Commencing December 16, 2019, we consolidate Hess Midstream LP, a variable interest entity that acquired Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), based on our conclusion that we have the power through Hess Corporation’s approximate 43.5% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. Prior to December 16, 2019, we consolidated HIP, also a variable interest entity based on the conclusion that we had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of HIP, and were obligated to absorb losses or had the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to HIP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered Hess Midstream LP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between Hess Midstream LP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of Hess Midstream LP. Our undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas E&P ventures are proportionately consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned and where we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method.Estimates and Assumptions: In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves, asset and other valuations, depreciable lives, pension liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes.Revenue Recognition:Exploration and ProductionThe E&P segment recognizes revenue from the sale of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as performance obligations under contracts with customers are satisfied. Our responsibilities to deliver each unit of quantity of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas under these contracts represent separate, distinct performance obligations. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer. Generally, the control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer upon the transfer of legal title at the point of physical delivery. Pricing is variable and is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials.For long-term international natural gas contracts with ship-or-pay provisions, our obligation to stand-ready to provide a minimum volume over each commitment period represents separate, distinct performance obligations. Penalties owed against future deliveries of natural gas due to delivery of volumes below minimum delivery commitments are recognized as reductions to revenue in the commitment period when the shortfall occurs. Long-term international natural gas contracts may also contain take-or-pay provisions whereby the customer is required to pay for volumes not taken that are below minimum volume commitments but the customer has certain make-up rights to receive shortfall volumes in subsequent periods. Shortfall payments received from customers when volumes purchased are below the minimum volume commitment are deferred upon receipt as a contract liability. Revenue is recognized at the earlier of when we deliver the make-up volumes in subsequent periods or when it becomes remote that the customer will exercise their make-up rights.59Certain crude oil, NGL, and natural gas volumes are purchased by Hess from third parties, including working interest partners and royalty owners in certain Hess-operated properties, before they are sold to customers. Where control over the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas transfers to Hess before the volumes are transferred to the customer, revenue and the associated cost of purchased volumes are presented on a gross basis in the Statement of Consolidated Income within Sales and other operating revenues and Marketing, including purchased oil and gas, respectively. Where control of crude oil, NGL, or natural gas is not transferred to Hess, revenue is presented net of the associated cost of purchased volumes within Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income.Contract Duration and Pricing:Contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. crude oil, NGL, and natural gas primarily include those contracts that involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period, and those contracts that automatically renew on a periodic basis until either party cancels. We have certain long-term contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. natural gas and NGL that have remaining durations ranging from one to eleven years. Contracts with customers for the sale of international crude oil involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period. Pricing is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials, shortly after control of the volumes transfers to the customer. International contracts with customers for the sale of natural gas are in the form of natural gas sales agreements with government entities that have durations that are aligned with the durations of production sharing contracts or other contractual arrangements with host governments. Pricing is determined using contractual formulas that are based on the price of alternative fuels as obtained from price indices and other factors.Contract Balances:Our right to receive or collect payment from the customer is aligned with the timing of revenue recognition except in situations when we receive shortfall payments under contracts with take-or-pay provisions with customer make-up rights.Generally, we receive payments from customers on a monthly basis, shortly after the physical delivery of the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas.Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations:The transaction price allocated to our wholly unsatisfied performance obligations on uncompleted contracts is variable. Further, many of our contracts with customers have durations of less than twelve months. Accordingly, we have elected under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers, the exemption from disclosure of revenue recognizable in future periods as these performance obligations are satisfied.Sales-based Taxes:We exclude sales-based taxes that are collected from customers from the transaction price in our contracts with customers. Accordingly, revenue from contracts with customers is net of sales-based taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities.MidstreamOur Midstream segment provides gathering, compression, processing, fractionation, storage, terminaling, loading and transportation, and water handling services.The Midstream segment has multiple long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with certain subsidiaries of Hess, each generally with an initial ten-year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. These contracts have minimum volumes the customer is obligated to provide each calendar quarter. The minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation based on nominations covering substantially all of our E&P segment’s production and projected third-party volumes that will be purchased in the Bakken. As the minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation, and as these contracts contain fee inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, substantially all of the transaction price at contract inception is variable. The midstream segment also has long-term, fee based commercial agreements for water handling services with a subsidiary of Hess with an initial 14 year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. Water handling services are provided for an agreed-upon fee per barrel or the reimbursement of third-party fees.The Midstream segment’s responsibilities to provide each of the above services for each year under each of the commercial agreements are considered separate, distinct performance obligations. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation under these commercial agreements over-time as services are rendered using the output method, measured using the amount of volumes serviced during the period. The Midstream segment has elected the practical expedient under the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue 60from Contracts with Customers to recognize revenue in the amount it is entitled to invoice. If the commercial agreements have ship-or-pay provisions, the Midstream segment’s responsibility to stand-ready to service a minimum volume over each quarterly commitment period represent separate, distinct performance obligations. Shortfall payments received under ship-or-pay provisions are recognized as revenue in the calendar quarter the shortfall occurs as the customer does not have make-up rights beyond the calendar quarter end of the quarterly commitment period. All revenues, receivables, and contract balances arising from the commercial agreements between the Midstream segment and the Hess subsidiaries that are the counterparty to the commercial agreements are eliminated upon consolidation.On December 30, 2020, Hess Midstream exercised its renewal options to extend the terms of certain gas gathering, crude oil gathering, gas processing and fractionation, storage, and terminal and export commercial agreements for the secondary term through December 31, 2033. There were no changes to any provisions of the existing commercial agreements as a result of the exercise of the renewal options.Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: We record depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production facilities and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.Capitalized Interest: Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets.Impairment of Long‑lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements.In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a projected amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows reported in Supplementary Oil and Gas Data, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over fair value, limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2021, goodwill of $360 million relates to the Midstream operating segment.Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily comprises cash on hand and on deposit, as well as highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired.61Inventories: Produced and unsold crude oil and NGL are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost of production plus any transport cost incurred in bringing the volumes to their present location. Materials and supplies are valued at cost. Obsolete or surplus materials identified during periodic reviews are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.Leases: We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception by evaluating whether the contract conveys the right to control an identified asset during the period of use. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an identified asset for the lease term and lease obligations represent our obligation to make payments as set forth in the lease arrangement. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as operating leases or finance leases at the commencement date based on the present value of the minimum lease payments over the lease term. Where the implicit discount rate in a lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date for determining the present value of the minimum lease payments. The lease term used in measurement of our lease obligations includes options to extend or terminate the lease when, in our judgment, it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the measurement of lease obligations using the index or rate at the commencement date. Variable lease payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances after the commencement date of the lease are not included in the minimum lease payments used to measure lease obligations. We have agreements that include financial obligations for lease and nonlease components. For purposes of measuring lease obligations, we have elected not to separate nonlease components from lease components for the following classes of assets: drilling rigs, office space, offshore vessels, and aircraft. We apply a portfolio approach to account for operating lease ROU assets and liabilities for certain vehicles, railcars, field equipment and office equipment leases.Finance lease cost is recognized as amortization of the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. Operating lease cost is generally recognized on a straight-line basis. Operating lease costs for drilling rigs used to drill development wells and successful exploration wells are capitalized. Operating lease cost for other ROU assets used in oil and gas producing activities are either capitalized or expensed on a straight-line basis based on the nature of operation for which the ROU asset is utilized.Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as permitted under ASC 842, Leases. We recognize lease cost for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Some of our leases include one or more options to renew. The renewal option is at our sole discretion and is not included in the lease term for measurement of the lease obligation unless we are reasonably certain at the commencement date of the lease, to renew the lease.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. We assign cumulative historical losses significant weight in the evaluation of realizability relative to more subjective evidence such as forecasts of future income. In addition, we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We are no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to the book in excess of tax basis in the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Because of U.S. tax reform we expect that the future reversal of such temporary differences will occur free of material taxation. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. We account for the U.S. tax effect of global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries in the period that such income is earned. We utilize the aggregate approach for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or the seabed at certain E&P locations. We initially recognize a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred and capitalize the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long‑lived assets. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Fair value is determined by applying a credit adjusted risk-free rate to the undiscounted expected future abandonment expenditures. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Income.62We measure asset retirement obligations based on the requirements of existing laws and regulations in accordance with ASC 410-20, Asset Retirement Obligations. Laws and regulations associated with the scope and timing for the abandonment of oil and gas wells, facilities and equipment could change which could increase the cost of our abandonment obligations. In addition, we may be required to assume abandonment obligations for certain divested assets in the event the current or future owners of facilities previously owned by us are unable to perform, whether due to bankruptcy or otherwise.Retirement Plans: We recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. We recognize the net changes in the funded status of these plans as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the year in which such changes occur. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the remaining average expected life if a plan’s participants are predominantly inactive.Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments for financial risk management activities. In these activities, we may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for financial assets, and our credit is considered for financial liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by GAAP. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying nonmonetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long‑lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows:Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity.Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange-traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded contracts.Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3.Netting of Financial Instruments: We generally enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate legal and counterparty credit risk. Master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty, commonly known as the “safe harbor” provisions. If a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterparty’s bankruptcy, these rights are generally enforceable with respect to “safe harbor” transactions. If these arrangements provide the right of offset and our intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination, our policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis. In the normal course of business, we rely on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses 63providing for adequate credit assurance as well as close‑out netting, including two‑party netting and single counterparty multilateral netting. As applied to us, “two‑party netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single Hess entity, and “single counterparty multilateral netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple Hess entities. We are reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.Share-based Compensation: We account for share-based compensation based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value of all share‑based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting terms, net of actual forfeitures. We estimate fair value at the date of grant using a Black‑Scholes valuation model for employee stock options and a Monte Carlo simulation model for performance share units (PSUs). Fair value of restricted stock is based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant.Foreign Currency Translation: The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in which business is conducted) for our foreign operations. Adjustments resulting from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.Maintenance and Repairs: Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capital improvements are recorded as additions in Property, plant and equipment.Environmental Expenditures: We accrue and expense the undiscounted environmental costs necessary to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year‑end 2021, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $60 million. Environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment are capitalized.2. InventoriesInventories at December 31 were as follows: 20212020 (In millions)Crude oil and natural gas liquids$52 $226 Materials and supplies171 152 Total Inventories$223 $378 At December 31, 2020, crude oil inventories included $164 million associated with the cost of 4.2 million barrels of crude oil transported and stored on two chartered VLCCs for sale in Asian markets. The two VLCC cargos were sold in the first quarter of 2021.3.

In 2019, other drilling activity included the Esox prospect in the Gulf of Mexico.Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves in 2020 resulted from sanctions of the Payara Field development, the third sanctioned project on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, and an additional phase of development at the North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia. In 2019, reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment resulted from sanction of the Liza Phase 2 development on the Stabroek Block and the Esox tieback well to the Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico.Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense in 2020 of $125 million primarily related to the northern portion of the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) in the Gulf of Mexico due to reprioritization of our forward capital program in response to the significant decline in crude oil prices. The preceding table excludes well costs incurred and expensed during 2021 of $11 million (2020: $67 million; 2019: $49 million).Exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling were $459 million at December 31, 2021, separated by year of completion as follows (in millions):2020$117 2019173 2018105 201727 2016 and prior37 $459 Guyana: Approximately 90% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to successful exploration wells where hydrocarbons were encountered on the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%). In the fourth quarter of 2021, the operator submitted a fourth development plan for the Yellowtail Field to the Government of Guyana for approval. The operator also plans further appraisal drilling and is conducting pre-development planning for additional phases of development.JDA: Approximately 8% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the JDA (Hess 50%) in the Gulf of Thailand, where hydrocarbons were encountered in three successful exploration wells drilled in the western part of Block A-18. The operator has submitted a development plan concept to the regulator to facilitate ongoing commercial negotiations for an extension of the existing gas sales contract to include development of the western part of the Block.Malaysia: Approximately 2% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to North Malay Basin (Hess 50%), offshore Peninsular Malaysia, where hydrocarbons were encountered in one successful exploration well. Subsurface evaluation and pre-development studies are ongoing.4. Hess Midstream LPHIP was initially formed on May 21, 2015, with Hess selling 50% of HIP to GIP for approximately $2.6 billion on July 1, 2015. On April 10, 2017, HIP completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 16,997,000 common units, representing 30.5% limited partnership interests in its subsidiary Hess Midstream Partners LP (Hess Midstream Partners), for net proceeds of approximately $365.5 million. In connection with the IPO, HIP contributed a 20% controlling economic interest in each of Hess North Dakota Pipeline Operations LP, Hess TGP Operations LP, and Hess North Dakota Export Logistics Operations LP, and a 100% economic interest in Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC (collectively the “Contributed Businesses”). In exchange for the contributed businesses, Hess and GIP each received common and subordinated units representing a direct 33.75% limited partner interest in Hess 65Midstream Partners and a 50% indirect ownership interest through HIP in Hess Midstream Partners’ general partner, which had a 2% economic interest in Hess Midstream Partners plus incentive distribution rights.On December 16, 2019, Hess Midstream Partners acquired HIP, including HIP’s 80% interest in Hess Midstream Partners’ oil and gas midstream assets, HIP’s water services business and the outstanding economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in Hess Midstream Partners LP. In addition, Hess Midstream Partners’ organizational structure converted from a master limited partnership into an “Up-C” structure in which Hess Midstream Partners’ public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares in a new public entity named Hess Midstream LP (Hess Midstream), which is taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Hess Midstream Partners changed its name to “Hess Midstream Operations LP” (HESM Opco) and became a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream, the new publicly listed entity. As consideration for the acquisition, Hess received a cash payment of $301 million and approximately 115 million newly issued HESM Opco Class B units. After giving effect to the acquisition and related transactions, public shareholders of Class A shares in Hess Midstream owned 6% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis and Hess and GIP each owned 47% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis, primarily through the sponsors’ ownership of Class B units in HESM Opco that are exchangeable into Class A shares of Hess Midstream on a one-for-one basis.In March 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of 6.9 million Class A shares held by Hess and GIP. These Class A shares of Hess Midstream were obtained by Hess and GIP through the exchange of 6.9 million of their Class B units of HESM Opco. As a result of this transaction, Hess received net proceeds of $70 million and recorded an increase in additional paid-in capital and noncontrolling interests of $56 million and $41 million, respectively. The increase of $41 million in noncontrolling interests is comprised of $14 million resulting from the change in ownership and $27 million due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset as a result of an increase in the tax basis of Hess Midstream LP's investment in HESM Opco.In August 2021, HESM Opco repurchased 31.25 million Class B units held by Hess and GIP for $750 million. Hess received net proceeds of $375 million. HESM Opco issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to finance the repurchase. The transaction resulted in an increase in additional paid-in capital and a decrease in noncontrolling interests of $28 million, and an increase in deferred tax assets and noncontrolling interests of $15 million due to a decrease in the book basis of Hess Midstream LP's investment in HESM Opco. The $375 million paid to GIP was recorded as a reduction to noncontrolling interests.In October 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of approximately 8.6 million Class A Shares held by Hess and GIP. These Class A shares of Hess Midstream were obtained by Hess and GIP through the exchange of approximately 8.6 million of their Class B units of HESM Opco. As a result of this transaction, Hess received net proceeds of $108 million and recorded an increase in additional paid-in capital and noncontrolling interests of $96 million and $62 million, respectively. The increase of $62 million in noncontrolling interests is comprised of $12 million resulting from the change in ownership and $50 million due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset as a result of an increase in the tax basis of Hess Midstream LP's investment in HESM Opco.After giving effect to the above transactions in 2021, public shareholders of Class A shares of Hess Midstream own approximately 13%, and Hess and GIP each own approximately 43.5%, of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis at December 31, 2021.Little Missouri 4 (LM4) is a 200 million standard cubic feet per day gas processing plant located south of the Missouri River in McKenzie County, North Dakota, that was constructed as part of a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Midstream and Targa Resources Corp. Hess Midstream has a natural gas processing agreement with LM4 under which it pays a processing fee and reimburses LM4 for its proportionate share of electricity costs. In 2021, these processing fees were $28 million (2020: $26 million; 2019: $6 million) and are included in Operating costs and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.At December 31, 2021, Hess Midstream liabilities totaling $2,694 million (2020: $2,026 million) are on a nonrecourse basis to Hess Corporation, while Hess Midstream assets available to settle the obligations of Hess Midstream included cash and cash equivalents totaling $2 million (2020: $3 million), property, plant and equipment, net totaling $3,125 million (2020: $3,111 million) and an equity-method investment in LM4 of $102 million (2020: $108 million).665.

The indentures for our fixed-rate public notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15%. As of December 31, 2021, Hess Corporation was in compliance with this financial covenant.69Term loan and credit facility:In March 2020, we entered into a $1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of March 16, 2023. In July 2021, we repaid $500 million of the $1 billion outstanding under the term loan, and in February 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million. The remaining $500 million has been classified as Current portion of long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 as it was our intent to repay the remaining $500 million in the first quarter of 2022.In 2019, we entered into a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 15, 2023. In April 2021, we amended this credit facility by extending this facility's expiration date for one year to May 2024 and incorporating customary provisions for the eventual replacement of LIBOR among other changes as set forth in the amended credit agreement. Borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.40% above LIBOR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. At December 31, 2021, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility.The revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15% (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement). As of December 31, 2021, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants.The most restrictive of the financial covenants related to our fixed-rate public notes and our term loan and revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional $1,843 million of secured debt at December 31, 2021.Other outstanding letters of credit at December 31 were as follows: 20212020 (In millions)Committed lines (a)$29 $54 Uncommitted lines (a)230 215 Total$259 $269 (a)At December 31, 2021, committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2022.Debt - Midstream:Senior unsecured fixed-rate public notes:In November 2017, HIP issued $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.625% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due in 2026. In December 2019, in connection with the acquisition of HIP and corporate restructuring described in Note 4, Hess Midstream LP, HESM Opco assumed $800 million of outstanding HIP senior unsecured notes in a par-for-par exchange. In addition, in December 2019, HESM Opco issued $550 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.125% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due in 2028 to finance the acquisition of HIP and repay outstanding borrowings under HIP’s credit facilities. In August 2021, HESM Opco issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due in 2030 in a private offering to finance the repurchase of 31.25 million HESM Opco Class B units held by Hess and GIP. These senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by certain of HESM Opco’s direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. These senior unsecured notes are non-recourse to Hess Corporation.Credit facilities:At December 31, 2021, HESM Opco had $1.4 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing December 2024, consisting of a $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn $400 million 5-year term loan A facility. The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund HESM Opco’s operating activities, capital expenditures, distributions and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 5-year term loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. HESM Opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2021. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of the assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2021, borrowings of $104 million were drawn 70under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $390 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s term loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation.8.

In August 2020, Fieldwood and related entities filed for bankruptcy relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Fieldwood’s Bankruptcy Plan, which was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in June 2021, includes the abandonment of certain assets, including seven offshore Gulf of Mexico leases and related facilities in the West Delta Field that were formerly owned by us and sold to a Fieldwood predecessor in 2004, and the discharge of Fieldwood’s obligation to decommission these facilities. As a result, in October 2021 and February 2022, we received decommissioning orders from the BSEE requiring us to decommission certain wells and related facilities located on six of the seven West Delta leases. We expect to receive additional orders covering the remainder of the West Delta decommissioning obligations in the near future and are actively engaged with the BSEE to agree on the scope and timing of decommissioning activities. Our decommissioning obligation derives from our former ownership of the facilities. We are seeking contribution from other parties that owned an interest in the facilities. Liabilities incurred in 2021 include $147 million representing total estimated abandonment obligations in the West Delta Field. Potential recoveries from other parties that previously owned an interest in the West Delta Field have not been recognized as of December 31, 2021.The liabilities settled or disposed of in 2021 primarily result from the sale of our interests in Denmark and abandonment activity completed in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken. Liabilities settled or disposed of in 2020 primarily result from an asset sale in the Gulf of Mexico and abandonment activity completed in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bakken and the U.K. North Sea. Revisions of estimated liabilities in 2021 and 2020 primarily reflect an acceleration of planned abandonment activity in the Gulf of Mexico and changes in service and equipment rates.Sinking fund deposits that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations, which are reported in non-current Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, were $233 million at December 31, 2021 (2020: $207 million).719. Retirement PlansWe have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a significant portion of our employees. In addition, we have an unfunded supplemental pension plan covering certain employees, which provides incremental payments that would have been payable from our principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary to our U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2017 and to our employees in the United Kingdom (U.K.). The U.S. employees hired on or after January 1, 2017 participate under a cash accumulation formula and receive credits to a notional account based on a percentage of pensionable wages. Interest accrues on the balance in the notional account at a rate determined in accordance with plan provisions. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded postretirement medical plan that provides health benefits to certain U.S. qualified retirees from ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement plans is December 31.The following table summarizes the benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of our pension and postretirement medical plans:FundedPension PlansUnfundedPension PlanPostretirementMedical Plan 202120202021202020212020 (In millions)Change in Benefit Obligation Balance at January 1, $3,085 $2,667 $269 $242 $65 $75 Service cost 41 37 10 13 3 3 Interest cost 52 68 3 5 1 1 Actuarial (gains) loss (a) (126)385 (8)26 (3)(8)Benefit payments (b) (100)(93)(26)(17)(7)(6)Plan amendments2 — — — — — Foreign currency exchange rate changes (6)21 — — — — Balance at December 31, (c)2,948 3,085 248 269 59 65 Change in Fair Value of Plan AssetsBalance at January 1,$3,043 $2,732 $— $— $— $— Actual return on plan assets 417 378 — — — — Employer contributions 6 4 26 17 7 6 Benefit payments (b) (100)(93)(26)(17)(7)(6)Foreign currency exchange rate changes (9)22 — — — — Balance at December 31,3,357 3,043 — — — — Funded Status (Plan assets greater (less) than benefit obligations) at December 31,$409 $(42)$(248)$(269)$(59)$(65)Unrecognized Net Actuarial (Gains) Losses$501 $900 $66 $86 $(21)$(19)(a)Changes in discount rates resulted in actuarial gains of $178 million in 2021 (2020: $387 million of actuarial losses).

Changes in mortality assumptions resulted in actuarial losses of $7 million in 2021 (2020: $18 million of actuarial gains). Changes in all other assumptions, including demographic assumptions, resulted in actuarial gains of $2 million in 2021 (2020: $10 million of actuarial losses).(b)Benefit payments include lump-sum settlement payments of $34 million in 2021 (2020: $23 million).(c)At December 31, 2021, the accumulated benefit obligation for the funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans was $2,856 million and $208 million, respectively (2020: $2,993 million and $228 million, respectively). Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31 consisted of the following:FundedPension PlansUnfundedPension PlanPostretirementMedical Plan 202120202021202020212020 (In millions)Noncurrent assets$409 $45 $— $— $— $— Current liabilities— — (34)(49)(6)(7)Noncurrent liabilities— (87)(214)(220)(53)(58)Pension assets / (accrued benefit liability)$409 $(42)$(248)$(269)$(59)$(65)Accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss, pre-tax (a)$501 $900 $66 $86 $(21)$(19)(a)The after‑tax deficit reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was $338 million at December 31, 2021 (2020: $759 million deficit).72The net periodic benefit cost for funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, is as follows: Pension PlansPostretirement Medical Plan 202120202019202120202019 (In millions)Service cost $51 $50 $44 $3 $3 $2 Interest cost 55 73 89 1 1 2 Expected return on plan assets (197)(180)(180)— — — Amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses (gains)58 48 52 (1)(1)(1)Settlement loss 9 — 93 — — — Curtailment gain— — — — — — Net Periodic Benefit Cost / (Income) (a)$(24)$(9)$98 $3 $3 $3 (a)Net non-service cost, which is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income, was income of $75 million in 2021 (2020: $59 million of income; 2019: $55 million of expense).In 2019, the trust for the Hess Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan (the “Plan”) purchased a single premium annuity contract at a cost of $249 million using assets of the Plan to settle and transfer certain of its obligations to a third party. The settlement transaction resulted in a noncash charge of $88 million to recognize unamortized pension actuarial losses that is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.In 2022, we forecast service cost for our pension and postretirement medical plans to be approximately $50 million and net non-service cost of approximately $135 million of income, which is comprised of interest cost of approximately $65 million, amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses of approximately $15 million, and estimated expected return on plan assets of approximately $215 million.Assumptions: The weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 and net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended December 31 for our funded and unfunded pension plans were as follows: 202120202019Benefit Obligations: Discount rate 2.5%2.2%2.9%Rate of compensation increase 3.8%3.8%3.8%Net Periodic Benefit Cost:Discount rateService cost2.6%3.2%3.9%Interest cost1.7%2.6%3.4%Expected return on plan assets 6.6%6.7%7.1%Rate of compensation increase 3.8%3.8%3.8%The actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 for the postretirement medical plan were as follows: 202120202019Discount rate 2.4%1.9%2.8%Initial health care trend rate 5.5%6.0%6.5%Ultimate trend rate 4.0%4.5%4.5%Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 204620382038The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year while the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year‑end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. The discount rate is developed based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations.The overall expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories.Our investment strategy is to maximize long‑term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes. Asset classes and target allocations are determined by our investment committee and include domestic and foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities issued by us unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets 73are highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements. The current target allocations for plan assets are 45% equity securities, 35% fixed income securities (including cash and short‑term investment funds) and 20% to all other types of investments. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target levels.Fair value: The following tables provide the fair value of the financial assets of the funded pension plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 in accordance with the fair value measurement hierarchy described in Note 1, Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies.

Commingled funds and limited partnership investments in hedge funds, private equity and real estate funds are valued at the NAV per fund share.Contributions and estimated future benefit payments: In 2022, we expect to contribute approximately $45 million to our funded pension plans.Estimated future benefit payments by the funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, which reflect expected future service, are as follows (in millions):2022$131 2023132 2024137 2025125 2026131 Years 2027 to 2031662 We also have defined contribution plans for certain eligible employees. Employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to these plans and we match a portion of the employee contributions. We recorded expense of $18 million in 2021 for contributions to these plans (2020: $22 million; 2019: $20 million).7510.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no contract assets.11. Dispositions2021: We completed the sale of our interests in Denmark for net cash consideration of approximately $130 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $29 million ($29 million after income taxes). In addition, we completed the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interests in the Bakken for net cash consideration of $297 million, after normal closing adjustments. The sale included approximately 78,700 net acres, which are located in the southernmost portion of the Corporation's Bakken position. The acreage constituted part of a larger amortization base and the sale was treated as a normal retirement. Accordingly, no gain or loss was recognized upon sale.2020: We completed the sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for proceeds of $482 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $79 million ($79 million after income taxes).2019: We completed the sale of our remaining acreage in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio for proceeds of $22 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes). 7612. Impairment and OtherOil and Gas Properties:In June 2021, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan for Fieldwood which includes transferring abandonment obligations of Fieldwood to predecessors in title of certain of its assets, including Hess, who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations. As a result, we recognized a charge of $147 million ($147 million after income taxes) in connection with total estimated abandonment obligations for seven leases in the West Delta Field in the Gulf of Mexico, which we sold to a Fieldwood predecessor in 2004. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations.As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the global economic slowdown from COVID-19, we reviewed our oil and gas properties within the Exploration and Production operating segment for impairment in the first quarter of 2020. We recognized pre-tax impairment charges in the first quarter of 2020 to reduce the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and certain related right-of-use assets at the North Malay Basin in Malaysia by $755 million ($755 million after income taxes), the South Arne Field in Denmark by $670 million ($594 million after income taxes), and in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede Field by $410 million ($410 million after income taxes) and the Tubular Bells Field by $270 million ($270 million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The impairment charges were based on estimates of fair value at March 31, 2020 determined by discounting internally developed future net cash flows, a Level 3 fair value measurement. The total of the fair value estimates was approximately $1.05 billion. Significant inputs used in determining the discounted future net cash flows include future prices, projected production volumes using risk adjusted oil and gas reserves, and discount rates. The future pricing assumptions used were based on forward strip crude oil prices as of March 31, 2020 for the remainder of 2020 through 2022, and $50 per barrel for WTI ($55 per barrel for Brent) in 2023 and thereafter to the end of field life. The weighted average crude oil benchmark price based on total projected crude oil volumes for the impaired assets was $48.82 per barrel. A discount rate of 10% was used in each of the fair value measurements which represents the estimated discount rate a market participant would use. We determined the discount rate by considering the weighted average cost of capital for a group of peer companies.Other Assets:In the first quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges totaling $21 million pre-tax ($20 million after income taxes) related to drilling rig right-of-use assets in the Bakken and surplus materials and supplies.13. Severance CostsWe incurred employee termination costs of $27 million in 2020 related to cost reduction initiatives. All charges were based on amounts incurred under ongoing severance arrangements or other statutory requirements, plus amounts earned under enhanced benefit arrangements. Payments for termination costs were $7 million in 2021 (2020: $20 million; 2019: $4 million).14. Share-based CompensationWe have established and maintain long term incentive plans (LTIP) for the granting of restricted common shares, performance share units (PSUs) and stock options to our employees. At December 31, 2021, the total number of authorized common stock under the LTIP was 63.5 million shares, of which we have 23.6 million shares available for issuance. Share‑based compensation expense consisted of the following: 202120202019 (In millions)Restricted stock$49 $51 $53 Performance share units18 18 22 Stock options10 10 10 Share-based compensation expense before income taxes$77 $79 $85 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation expense$— $— $— Based on share‑based compensation awards outstanding at December 31, 2021, unearned compensation expense, before income taxes, of $79 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. 77Our share-based compensation plans can be summarized as follows:Restricted stock: Restricted stock generally vests equally on an annual basis over a three-year term and is valued based on the prevailing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.

The number of shares of common stock to be issued under a PSU agreement is based on a comparison of the Corporation’s total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies over a three-year performance period ending December 31 of the year prior to settlement of the grant. Beginning with the PSUs granted in 2020, the Corporation's TSR is compared to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies and the S&P 500 index over the three-year performance period. Payouts of the performance share awards will range from 0% to 200% of the target awards based on the Corporation’s TSR ranking within the peer group. Dividend equivalents for the performance period will accrue on performance shares but will only be paid out on earned shares after the performance period.

The deferred tax asset is comprised of $300 million attributable to foreign net operating losses which will begin to expire in 2025, $3,507 million attributable to U.S. federal operating losses which will begin to expire in 2034, and $516 million attributable to losses in various U.S. states which will begin to expire in 2022. The deferred tax asset attributable to foreign net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, is $166 million. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to U.S. federal and state net operating losses, except for $12 million of U.S. federal and $3 million of U.S. state deferred tax assets attributable to Midstream activities for which separate U.S. federal and state tax returns are filed. At December 31, 2021, we have U.S. state tax credit carryforwards of $18 million, which will begin to expire in 2034, $71 million of other business credit carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2036, and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1 million, which will begin to expire in 2024. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to these credits. At December 31, 2021, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $3,838 million (2020: $5,391 million) valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on application of the relevant accounting standards. Hess continues 80to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the U.S. (non-Midstream) and Malaysia, and other certain jurisdictions, and did so against its deferred tax assets in Denmark prior to its sale in 2021 (see Note 11, Dispositions). The reduction in valuation allowance year over year is primarily due to the sale of the Denmark asset with its deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance being derecognized as part of net basis of property sold and partially due to a reduction in deferred tax asset balances in jurisdictions where we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. The cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ending December 31, 2021 constitutes significant objective negative evidence. Such objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider subjective positive evidence, such as our projections of future taxable income, resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for these jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence.Below is a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: 202120202019 (In millions)Balance at January 1$166 $168 $168 Additions based on tax positions taken in the current year12 2 2 Additions based on tax positions of prior years3 1 1 Reductions based on tax positions of prior years(48)(2)(1)Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities— (1)— Reductions due to lapses in statutes of limitation— (2)(2)Balance at December 31$133 $166 $168 The December 31, 2021 balance of unrecognized tax benefits includes $15 million that, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. Over the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between zero and $15 million due to settlements with taxing authorities or other resolutions, as well as lapses in statutes of limitation. At December 31, 2021, our accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is $6 million (2020: $6 million).We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to examinations by income tax authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2009. 8116.

Guarantees, Contingencies and CommitmentsGuarantees and ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages.We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the U.S. against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are two remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit, filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants.In September 2003, we received a directive from the NJDEP to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and agreed with the EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a ROD in respect of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an estimated cost of $1.38 billion. The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a final remedy for the entirety of the Lower Passaic River or the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed 83contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages.In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. The remedy selected by the EPA includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. The EPA’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA’s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us, and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design.From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. Beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. These proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Beginning in 2013, various parishes in Louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies, including us, alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, the payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. The ultimate impact of such climate and other aforementioned environmental proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates.We are also involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings from time to time in addition to the matters described above, including claims related to post-production deductions from royalty payments. We may also be exposed to future decommissioning liabilities for divested assets in the event the current or future owners of facilities previously owned by us are determined to be unable to perform such actions, whether due to bankruptcy or otherwise. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding.Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments The following table shows aggregate information for certain unconditional purchase obligations and commitments at December 31, 2021, which are not included elsewhere within these Consolidated Financial Statements: Payments Due by PeriodTotal20222023 and20242025 and2026Thereafter (In millions)Capital expenditures$3,263 $1,028 $1,458 $777 $— Operating expenses180 132 42 6 — Transportation and related contracts2,574 390 639 453 1,092 8419.

Financial Risk Management ActivitiesIn the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, corporate financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. We maintain a control environment for all of our financial risk management activities under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Corporate Financial Risk Management Activities: Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas we produce or by reducing our exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to fix the forward selling price, or establish a floor price or a range banded with a floor and ceiling price, for a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we conduct business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. At December 31, 2021, these forward contracts relate to the British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Malaysian Ringgit. Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates.The notional amounts of outstanding financial risk management derivative contracts were as follows: December 31, 2021December 31, 2020 (In millions)Commodity - crude oil hedge contracts (millions of barrels)54.8 27.4 Foreign exchange forwards$145 $163 Interest rate swaps$100 $100 For calendar year 2022, we have hedged 90,000 bopd with WTI collars with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $100 per barrel, and 60,000 bopd with Brent collars with an average monthly floor price of $65 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $105 per barrel. 86The table below reflects the gross and net fair values of risk management derivative instruments: AssetsLiabilities (In millions)December 31, 2021 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments: Crude oil collars$155 $— Interest rate swaps2 — Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments157 — Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Foreign exchange forwards— (1)Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments— (1)Gross fair value of derivative contracts157 (1)Gross amount offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet— — Net Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet$157 $(1)December 31, 2020Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments:Crude oil put options$64 $— Crude oil swaps— (54)Interest rate swaps5 — Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments69 (54)Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Foreign exchange forwards— (1)Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments— (1)Gross fair value of derivative contracts69 (55)Gross amount offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet(13)13 Net Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet$56 $(42)At December 31, 2021, the fair value of our crude oil collars is presented within Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of our crude oil put options and crude oil swaps is presented within Other current assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is presented within Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of our foreign exchange forwards is presented within Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. All fair values in the table above are based on Level 2 inputs.Derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments:Crude oil hedge contracts: In 2021, crude oil price hedging contracts decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $243 million (2020: increase of $547 million; 2019: increase of $1 million). At December 31, 2021, pre-tax deferred losses in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to outstanding crude oil price hedging contracts were $68 million ($68 million after income taxes), all of which will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings.Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: At December 31, 2021, we had interest rate swaps with gross notional amounts of $100 million (2020: $100 million), which were designated as fair value hedges and relate to long-term debt where we have converted interest payments from fixed to floating rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and the hedged fixed‑rate debt are recorded in Interest expense in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2021, the change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a decrease of $3 million (2020: $4 million increase; 2019: $3 million increase) with a corresponding adjustment in the carrying value of the hedged fixed‑rate debt.Derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments:Foreign exchange: Total foreign exchange gains and losses were losses of $2 million in 2021 (2020: loss of $6 million; 2019: gain of $3 million) and are reported in Other, net in Revenues and non-operating income in the Statement of Consolidated Income. A component of foreign exchange gains or losses is the result of foreign exchange derivative contracts that are not designated as hedges, which amounted to a net gain of $1 million in 2021 (2020: net gain of $2 million; 2019: net loss of $2 million).Credit Risk: We are exposed to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, groups of counterparties or customers. Accounts receivable are generated from a diverse domestic and international customer base. At December 31, 2021, our Accounts receivable were concentrated with the following counterparty industry segments: Integrated companies — 50%, Independent E&P companies — 31%, Refining and marketing companies — 9%, National oil companies — 3%, 87Storage and transportation companies — 3%, and Others — 4%. We reduce risk related to certain counterparties, where applicable, by using master netting arrangements and requiring collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $259 million (2020: $269 million). Fair Value Measurement: At December 31, 2021, our total long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments, had a carrying value of $8,458 million and a fair value of $9,897 million, based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. We also have short-term financial instruments, primarily cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, for which the carrying value approximated fair value at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.21. Subsequent EventsFollowing the startup of the Liza Phase 2 project in February 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding under our $1 billion term loan and we announced a 50 percent increase in our quarterly dividend on common stock. In January 2022, we paid accrued Libyan income tax and royalties of approximately $470 million related to operations for the period December 2020 through November 2021. 88HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIESSUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DATA (UNAUDITED)The Supplementary Oil and Gas Data that follows is presented in accordance with ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities, and includes (1) costs incurred, capitalized costs and results of operations relating to oil and gas producing activities, (2) net proved oil and gas reserves and (3) a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves, including a reconciliation of changes therein.

Proved oil and gas reserves are quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by our internal teams of geoscience and reservoir engineering professionals. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of June 25, 2019).” The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir, the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate, the stage of reservoir development and the production history. Subsurface data used included well logs, reservoir core and fluid samples, production and pressure testing, static and dynamic pressure information, and reservoir surveillance. Where applicable, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC regulations. These technologies, including computational methods, must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In some cases, where appropriate, use of empirical and analytical methods, combined with analog data were used. Analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies were used to increase the quality and confidence in the reserves estimates.In order for reserves to be classified as proved, any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project, either senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the development. Our proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10‑K.In 2021, we announced our new five year GHG reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 52% from 2017. In January 2022, we announced our plan to reduce routine flaring at Hess operated assets to zero by the end of 2025. The impact of these targets on our production operations was reflected in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2021.Internal ControlsThe Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation processes, which are administered by our Global Reserves group and our Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff who work directly with the oil and gas properties using industry standard reserve estimation principles, definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates of the Corporation’s assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an independent third-party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves (see pages 91 through 96). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors.QualificationsThe person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves during 2021 was the Senior Manager, Global Reserves. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has 19 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a MSc degree in Petroleum Engineering. His experience has been primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas. He is also responsible for the Corporation’s Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization that establishes the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews.Reserves AuditWe engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating approximately 88% of 2021 year‑end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (2020: 92%). The purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D&M report, dated February 2, 2022, on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry. D&M is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. D&M’s letter report on the Corporation’s December 31, 2021 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this Form 10‑K. While the D&M report should be read in its entirety, the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M, the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and independently evaluated by D&M, in the aggregate, differed by less than 2.5% (2020: less than 1%) of total audited net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The report also includes among other information, the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve audit. 91Crude Oil Prices Used to Estimate Proved ReservesProved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period before December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2021 were $66.34 per barrel for WTI (2020: $39.77; 2019: $55.73) and $68.92 per barrel for Brent (2020: $43.43; 2019: $62.54). New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were $3.68 per mcf in 2021 (2020: $2.16; 2019: $2.54).At December 31, 2021, spot prices closed at $75.21 per barrel for WTI and $77.02 per barrel for Brent. If crude oil prices in 2022 are at levels below that used in determining 2021 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2022 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2022 above those used in determining 2021 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2022. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2022, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2022 crude oil prices, the amount of any additions to proved reserves, positive or negative revisions in proved reserves related to 2022 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2022 crude oil prices, and management’s plans as of December 31, 2022 for developing proved undeveloped reserves.

Additions to proved developed reserves primarily resulted from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 270 million boe (157 million barrels of crude oil, 66 million barrels of NGL and 285 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 95.2020: Total Additions were 142 million boe, of which 12 million boe (8 million barrels of crude oil, 2 million barrels of NGL and 14 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves primarily resulted from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 130 million boe (98 million barrels of crude oil, 16 million barrels of NGL and 93 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 95.2019: Total Additions were 228 million boe, of which 25 million boe (13 million barrels of crude oil, 6 million barrels of NGL and 35 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves primarily resulted from new wells drilled in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions in the U.S. also included two wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 203 million boe (144 million barrels of crude oil, 34 million barrels of NGL and 149 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 95. 93Revisions of previous estimates2021: Total revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves amounted to a net increase of 53 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to an increase of 73 million boe (31 million barrels of crude oil, 27 million barrels of NGL and 88 million mcf of natural gas). In the U.S., net positive revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken of 68 million boe were due to higher commodity prices (39 million boe) and improved well performance (32 million boe), partially offset by other negative revisions of 3 million boe. In the Gulf of Mexico, positive revisions to proved developed reserves were 10 million boe, including 5 million boe of positive price revisions and 5 million boe of other revisions, primarily improved well performance. In Malaysia and JDA, net negative revisions to proved developed reserves were 6 million boe due to the impact of higher commodity prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract at JDA (50%) and performance at North Malay Basin and JDA (50%). Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 95.2020: Total revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves amounted to a net decrease of 25 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to an increase of 108 million boe (38 million barrels of crude oil, 30 million barrels of NGL and 237 million mcf of natural gas). In the U.S., revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken were a net increase of 55 million boe, comprised of positive revisions of 77 million boe and negative price revisions of 22 million boe. The positive revisions resulted from well performance (50%), updated yield and decline factors (30%) and other changes (20%), primarily driven by cost reductions. In the Gulf of Mexico, net negative revisions were 8 million boe, including 2 million boe of negative price revisions. In Guyana, revisions increased proved developed reserves by 47 million boe related to performance (55%), improved recovery associated with water injection (35%), and increased natural gas for consumption (10%). In Malaysia and JDA, net revisions to proved developed reserves were an increase of 18 million boe due to performance at North Malay Basin and JDA (80%) and the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract at JDA (20%). Other had negative revisions to proved developed reserves of 4 million boe, primarily in Libya. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 95.2019: Total revisions of previous estimates amounted to a net decrease of 107 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net decrease of 19 million boe (7 million barrels of NGL and 72 million mcf of natural gas). Revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken were a net decrease of 25 million boe with approximately 80% relating to changes in expected recoveries of NGL and natural gas and approximately 20% relating to the impact of lower prices. Net revisions from international assets were an increase of 6 million boe. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 95.Sales of minerals in place (‘Asset sales’)2021: Asset sales relate to the divestiture of our working interests in Denmark and our acreage interests in the Little Knife and Murphy Creek area of the Bakken.2020: Asset sales relate to the divestiture of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.Proved Undeveloped ReservesFollowing are the Corporation’s proved undeveloped reserves: UnitedStatesGuyanaMalaysia and JDAOther (a)Total (Millions of boe)Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 1, 2019389423718486Revisions of previous estimates(91)9—(6)(88)Extensions, discoveries and other additions15434—15203Transfers to proved developed reserves(108)(29)(4)(2)(143)At December 31, 2019344563325458Revisions of previous estimates(146)42(4)(25)(133)Extensions, discoveries and other additions78502—130Transfers to proved developed reserves(85)(8)(7)—(100)Sales of minerals in place(3)———(3)At December 31, 202018814024—352Revisions of previous estimates(16)(4)——(20)Extensions, discoveries and other additions25794—270Transfers to proved developed reserves(19)—(4)—(23)Sales of minerals in place(39)———(39)At December 31, 202137114524—540(a)Other includes our interests in Denmark, which were sold in August 2021, and Libya. 94Extensions, discoveries and other additions (‘Additions’)2021: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 257 million boe, which resulted from additional undeveloped well locations due to improved economic conditions, planned additional drilling activity, and development plan optimization. In Guyana, additions of 9 million boe related to the deepening of the hydrocarbon contact for Liza Phase 2. In Malaysia and JDA, additions were due to additional planned wells to be drilled.2020: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 78 million boe, which primarily resulted from new wells planned to be drilled in the next five years, including the impact of optimizing locations in the development plan. In Guyana, additions of 50 million boe were due to the sanction of the Payara project. In Malaysia, additions at the North Malay Basin were due to additional planned wells to be drilled.2019: In the United States, additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 154 million boe, of which approximately 25% of the change results from additional planned wells to be drilled in the next five years, and approximately 75% results from new wells moved into the five-year plan associated with optimization of drilling locations. Additions in Guyana totaling 34 million boe are from the sanction of Phase 2 development at the Liza Field on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. Other additions were at the South Arne Field in Denmark and in Libya due to additional planned wells to be drilled.Revisions of previous estimates2021: In the United States, net negative reserve revisions of 16 million boe were primarily from the Bakken, which included a decrease of 88 million boe largely related to wells moved outside the five-year development plan mainly based on optimization of drilling locations and other net negative revisions of 8 million boe, partially offset by positive revisions of 80 million boe related to higher prices. In Guyana, net negative reserve revisions were 4 million boe, which included negative revisions of 16 million boe related to the impact of higher crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract and negative revisions of 3 million boe resulting from decreased natural gas for consumption. Positive revisions of 15 million boe in Guyana resulted from improved recovery associated with water and gas injection.2020: In the United States, negative reserve revisions of 146 million boe were from the Bakken, which included negative price revisions of 77 million boe, and a decrease of 121 million boe from wells moved outside our management and Board approved five-year plan due to a reduction in planned rig count and optimization of drilling locations in response to the decline in crude oil prices in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by positive revisions of 52 million boe, primarily due to optimized development spacing and increased well productivity. In Guyana, net positive reserve revisions for Liza Phase 1 and Phase 2 totaling 42 million boe resulted from improved recovery associated with water injection (45%), the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract (40%) and increased natural gas for consumption (15%). For Other, net negative reserves revisions were 14 million boe in Libya and 11 million boe in Denmark due to moving planned wells outside our five-year plan in response to the decline in crude oil prices in 2020.2019: Negative reserve revisions in the United States of 91 million boe were largely from the Bakken (94 million boe), of which approximately 75% resulted from wells moved outside our five-year plan associated with optimization of drilling locations. The remaining 25% of negative revisions in the Bakken were caused by lower commodity prices. The net positive reserve revisions in Guyana of 9 million boe relate to the Liza Phase 1 development due to the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing agreement.Transfers to proved developed reserves (‘Transfers’)2021: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves resulting from drilling activity included 19 million boe in the Bakken, and 4 million boe at JDA. Transfers in 2021 were consistent with the development plan used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2020.2020: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves resulting from drilling activity included 83 million boe in the Bakken, 2 million boe in the Gulf of Mexico, 8 million boe for Liza Phase 1 in Guyana, and 7 million boe in the North Malay Basin.2019: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves included 100 million boe in the Bakken associated with drilling activity, 29 million boe at the Stabroek Block in Guyana where first production was achieved in 2019, and 8 million boe at the Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico associated with drilling activity.In 2021, capital expenditures of $190 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (2020: $1,090 million; 2019: $1,750 million).At December 31, 2021, projects that have proved reserves that have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess of five years totaled 11 million boe, or less than 1% of total proved reserves, related to the multi-phase offshore developments, primarily at North Malay Basin, offshore Malaysia, and the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. 95Production Sharing ContractsThe Corporation’s proved reserves include crude oil and natural gas reserves relating to long‑term agreements with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the legal right to produce or has a revenue interest in the production. The Corporation's operations with these production sharing arrangements include those in Guyana, Malaysia, and the JDA. Proved reserves for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021, as well as volumes produced and received during 2021, 2020 and 2019 from these production sharing contracts are presented in the proved reserve tables on pages 92 and 93. Revisions resulting from the entitlement impact of price changes in production sharing contracts decreased proved reserves by 17 million boe in 2021 (2020: 22 million boe increase; 2019: 5 million boe increase). 96Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas ReservesFuture net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining year‑end reserve estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development and production costs, which are based on year‑end costs and existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year‑end statutory tax rates to the pre‑tax net cash flows, as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%.The prices used for the discounted future net cash flows in 2021 were $66.34 per barrel for WTI (2020: $39.77; 2019: $55.73) and $68.92 per barrel for Brent (2020: $43.43; 2019: $62.54) and do not include the effects of commodity hedges. NYMEX natural gas prices used were $3.68 per mcf in 2021 (2020: $2.16; 2019: $2.54). Selling prices have in the past, and can in the future, fluctuate significantly. As a result, selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices. In addition, the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The amount of tax deductions, credits, and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves, variances in actual pre-tax cash flows from forecasted pre-tax cash flows in historical periods, and the impact to year-end carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the Corporation’s income tax returns exploration expenses, interest expense, and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not contemplated in the standardized measure computations. The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used.At December 31TotalUnitedStatesGuyanaMalaysia and JDAOther (a) (In millions)2021 Future revenues$55,788 $32,054 $13,940 $2,759 $7,035 Less:Future production costs15,553 11,246 3,043 910 354 Future development costs8,122 4,342 3,063 543 174 Future income tax expenses11,257 3,625 1,516 151 5,965 34,932 19,213 7,622 1,604 6,493 Future net cash flows20,856 12,841 6,318 1,155 542 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate9,603 7,073 2,091 193 246 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$11,253 $5,768 $4,227 $962 $296 2020Future revenues$28,745 $11,757 $8,362 $2,578 $6,048 Less:Future production costs12,360 6,887 2,784 1,073 1,616 Future development costs6,322 2,593 2,617 677 435 Future income tax expenses4,135 45 380 110 3,600 22,817 9,525 5,781 1,860 5,651 Future net cash flows5,928 2,232 2,581 718 397 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate2,343 1,205 935 123 80 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$3,585 $1,027 $1,646 $595 $317 2019Future revenues$44,778 $25,223 $5,326 $3,473 $10,756 Less:Future production costs14,176 10,189 931 1,238 1,818 Future development costs8,267 5,104 1,549 823 791 Future income tax expenses8,560 1,291 505 162 6,602 31,003 16,584 2,985 2,223 9,211 Future net cash flows13,775 8,639 2,341 1,250 1,545 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate5,390 3,872 539 270 709 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$8,385 $4,767 $1,802 $980 $836 (a)Other includes our interests in Denmark, which were sold in August 2021, and Libya. 97Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas ReservesFor the Years Ended December 31202120202019 (In millions)Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at January 1$3,585 $8,385 $10,650 Changes during the year:Sales and transfers of oil and gas produced during the year, net of production costs(3,282)(1,829)(2,842)Development costs incurred during the year1,437 1,479 2,262 Net changes in prices and production costs11,321 (10,141)(5,761)Net change in estimated future development costs(1,695)1,860 (186)Extensions and discoveries (including improved recovery) of oil and gas reserves, less related costs2,419 543 1,591 Revisions of previous oil and gas reserve estimates461 364 (281)Net purchases (sales) of minerals in place, before income taxes(196)(500)— Accretion of discount578 1,220 1,635 Net change in income taxes(3,477)2,091 1,305 Revision in rate or timing of future production and other changes102 113 12 Total7,668 (4,800)(2,265)Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at December 31$11,253 $3,585 $8,385 98Item 9.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A.The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations omits certain discussions of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020, which can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2022, and such comparisons are incorporated herein by reference.IndexOverviewConsolidated Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOverviewHess Corporation is a global E&P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located in the United States, Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we and our partners have discovered a significant resource base and are executing a multi-phased development of the block. We currently plan to have six FPSOs with an aggregate expected production capacity of more than 1.2 million gross bopd on the Stabroek Block in 2027, and the potential for up to ten FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base.Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s approximate 41% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2022, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota.Climate Change, Energy Transition and Our StrategyWe believe climate risks can and should be addressed while at the same time meeting the growing demand for affordable and secure energy, which is essential to ensure a just and orderly energy transition that aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The IEA's 2022 World Energy Outlook provides three scenarios of global energy demand in 2040 based on varying levels of global response to climate change. Under all of the IEA scenarios, oil and natural gas are expected to be needed for decades to come and we expect that significant investment will be required to meet the world’s projected growing energy needs, both in renewable energy sources and in oil and gas.Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. Our strategy aligns with the energy transition needed to reach the energy-related Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Our commitment to sustainability starts with our Board of Directors and senior management and is reinforced throughout our organization. Our Board of Directors, led by its Environmental, Health and Safety Committee, is actively engaged in overseeing Hess’ sustainability practices so that sustainability risks and opportunities are taken into account when making strategic decisions. Our Board’s Compensation and Management Development Committee has tied executive compensation to advancing our environmental, health and safety goals. We also have an executive led task force to guide our medium and longer term climate strategy.We have five year GHG reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity by approximately 50% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50%, both from 2017 levels. In January 2022, we announced our plan to reduce routine flaring at Hess operated assets to zero by the end of 2025. In December 2022, we announced an agreement with the Government of Guyana to purchase 37.5 million REDD+ carbon credits, including current and future issuances, for a minimum of $750 million from 2022 through 2032 to prevent deforestation and support sustainable development in Guyana. This agreement adds to the Corporation's ongoing emissions reduction efforts and is an important part of our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis by 2050.25Our business planning includes actions we expect to undertake to continue reducing our carbon footprint consistent with our targets. We also conduct annual scenario planning as a methodology to assess our portfolio’s resilience to differing scenarios of energy supply and demand over the longer term, and to inform our understanding of future risks and opportunities in relation to the potential evolution of energy demand, energy mix, the emergence of new technologies, and possible changes by policymakers with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.2022 Return of Capital Highlights and 2023 Outlook Following the startup of the Liza Phase 2 project in February 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding under our $1.0 billion term loan, and in March 2022, we announced a 50% increase to our quarterly dividend on common stock. In 2022, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares of common stock for $650 million.Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are projected to be approximately $3.7 billion in 2023, up from $2.7 billion in 2022. Capital investment for our Midstream operations is expected to be approximately $225 million, compared with $232 million in 2022. Oil and gas net production in 2023 is forecast to be in the range of 355,000 boepd to 365,000 boepd, up from 327,000 boepd in 2022, pro forma for assets sold. For 2023, we have hedged 80,000 bopd with WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $70 per barrel, and 10,000 bopd with Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $75 per barrel. Consolidated ResultsNet income attributable to Hess Corporation was $2,096 million in 2022 compared with $559 million in 2021. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 29, adjusted net income was $2,176 million in 2022 compared with $677 million in 2021. Net production averaged 344,000 boepd in 2022 and 315,000 boepd in 2021. The average realized crude oil price, including the effect of hedging, was $85.76 per barrel in 2022 and $60.08 per barrel in 2021. Total proved reserves were 1,256 million boe and 1,309 million boe at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.Significant 2022 ActivitiesThe following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2022:E&P assets:•In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken shale play averaged 154,000 boepd in 2022 (2021: 156,000 boepd). Net production was lower in 2022 primarily due to unplanned production shut-ins caused by severe winter weather partially offset by increased wells on-line. We drilled 78 wells and brought 69 wells on production in 2022, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,664 at December 31, 2022. Prior to COVID-19, we were operating six rigs in the Bakken, but reduced the rig count to one in May 2020 in response to the sharp decline in crude oil prices. We added a second operated rig in the Bakken in February 2021, a third operated rig in September 2021 and a fourth operated rig in July 2022. During 2023, we plan to operate four rigs, drill approximately 110 wells and bring approximately 110 wells on production. We forecast net production from the Bakken to be in the range of 165,000 boepd to 170,000 boepd in 2023.•In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 31,000 boepd in 2022 (2021: 45,000 boepd). Net production was lower in 2022 primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells, Penn State and Llano Fields. For 2023, net production from the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be approximately 30,000 boepd.•At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, net production from the Liza Destiny and Unity FPSOs totaled 78,000 bopd in 2022 (2021: 30,000 bopd). The Liza Unity FPSO, which commenced production in February 2022, reached its production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd in July 2022.In the third quarter of 2022, we used the remainder of our previously generated Guyana net operating loss carryforwards and started incurring a current income tax liability. Pursuant to the contractual arrangements of the petroleum agreement, a portion of gross production from the block, separate from the joint venture partners' (Co-Venturers) cost oil and profit oil entitlement, is used to satisfy the Co-Venturers’ income tax liability. This portion of gross production, referred to as tax barrels, is recognized as Co-Venturer production volumes and estimated proved reserves. Net production from Guyana in 2022 included 7,000 bopd of tax barrels (2021: 0 bopd). For 2023, we forecast net production to be approximately 100,000 bopd, which includes approximately 10,000 bopd of tax barrels.The third development, Payara, was sanctioned in 2020 and will utilize the Prosperity FPSO, which will have an expected production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected by the end of 2023. Ten drill centers with a total of 41 wells are planned, including 20 production wells and 21 injection wells.A fourth development, Yellowtail, was sanctioned in April 2022 and will utilize the ONE GUYANA FPSO with an expected production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first production expected in 2025. Six drill centers are planned with up to 26 production wells and 25 injection wells.26A fifth development, Uaru, was submitted to the Government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter of 2022. Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, the project is expected to have a production capacity of approximately 250,000 gross bopd, with first oil anticipated at the end of 2026. In addition to the first five developments, planning is underway for additional FPSOs. The ultimate sizing and order of these potential developments will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling.In 2022, the operator drilled a total of ten successful exploration and appraisal wells that encountered hydrocarbons and one unsuccessful exploration well, Banjo-1, for which the well costs were expensed. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the operator completed one successful exploration well that encountered hydrocarbons, and one unsuccessful exploration well, Fish/Tarpon-1, for which well costs incurred through December 31, 2022 were expensed. See Note 20, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.In 2023, the operator plans to utilize six drillships to drill approximately ten exploration and appraisal wells in addition to development wells for the sanctioned developments.•In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A‑18 of the JDA averaged 38,000 boepd in 2022 (2021: 36,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, while net production from North Malay Basin averaged 26,000 boepd in 2022 (2021: 25,000 boepd). In 2023, we forecast net production from North Malay Basin and JDA combined to be in the range of 60,000 boepd to 65,000 boepd.•In Libya, we completed the sale of our interest in the Waha Concession in November for net proceeds of $150 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $76 million ($76 million after income taxes). Net production from Libya was 17,000 boepd in 2022.The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2022:•In April 2022, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 10.2 million Class A shares held by Hess and GIP. As a result of this transaction, Hess received net proceeds of $146 million. •Concurrent with the April 2022 public offering, HESM Opco repurchased approximately 13.6 million Class B units held by Hess and GIP for $400 million, with Hess receiving net proceeds of $200 million. HESM Opco issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility used to finance the repurchase.27Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory ExpendituresAt December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $2,486 million (2021: $2,713 million) and consolidated debt was $8,281 million (2021: $8,458 million), which includes Hess Midstream debt that is nonrecourse to Hess Corporation of $2,886 million at December 31, 2022 (2021: $2,564 million).Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions): 202220212020E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures: United States North Dakota$807 $522 $661 Offshore and other224 103 258 Total United States1,031 625 919 Guyana1,345 1,016 743 Malaysia and JDA275 154 99 Other (a)70 34 25 E&P Capital and Exploratory Expenditures$2,721 $1,829 $1,786 Exploration Expenses Charged to Income Included Above: United States$107 $90 $91 International25 41 17 Total Exploration Expenses Charged to Income included above$132 $131 $108 Midstream Capital Expenditures: Midstream Capital Expenditures$232 $183 $253 (a)Other includes our interests in Libya (sold in November 2022) and Denmark (sold in August 2021), and certain non-producing countries.In 2023, we project our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $3.7 billion, of which more than 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken, and Midstream capital expenditures to be approximately $225 million.Consolidated Results of OperationsResults by Segment:The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 202220212020 (In millions, except per share amounts)Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation: Exploration and Production$2,396 $770 $(2,841)Midstream269 286 230 Corporate, Interest and Other(569)(497)(482)Total$2,096 $559 $(3,093)Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation Per Common Share – Diluted (a)$6.77 $1.81 $(10.15)(a)Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares.In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.28Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods:The following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods.

Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations.Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to evaluate the Corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt and believes that 29investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods.These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.Comparison of ResultsExploration and ProductionFollowing is a summarized statement of income for our E&P operations: 202220212020 (In millions)Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues$11,324 $7,473 $4,667 Gains on asset sales, net76 29 79 Other, net102 64 31 Total revenues and non-operating income11,502 7,566 4,777 Costs and Expenses Marketing, including purchased oil and gas3,394 2,119 1,067 Operating costs and expenses1,186 965 895 Production and severance taxes255 172 124 Midstream tariffs1,193 1,094 946 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment208 162 351 General and administrative expenses224 191 206 Depreciation, depletion and amortization1,520 1,361 1,915 Impairment and other54 147 2,126 Total costs and expenses8,034 6,211 7,630 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes3,468 1,355 (2,853)Provision (benefit) for income taxes1,072 585 (12)Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$2,396 $770 $(2,841)Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 34, the changes in E&P results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, Midstream tariffs, DD&A expense, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below.30Selling Prices: Average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 43% higher in 2022 compared with the prior year, primarily due to the increase in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for NGL increased in 2022 by 15% and worldwide natural gas prices increased in 2022 by 23%, compared with the prior year. In total, higher realized selling prices improved after-tax results by approximately $1,490 million, compared with 2021. Our average selling prices were as follows: 202220212020Average Selling Prices (a)Crude Oil – Per Barrel (Including Hedging) United States North Dakota$81.06 $55.57 $42.63 Offshore81.38 60.09 45.92 Total United States81.14 56.64 43.56 Guyana89.86 68.57 46.41 Malaysia and JDA89.77 71.00 37.91 Other (b)93.67 66.39 51.37 Worldwide85.76 60.08 44.28 Crude Oil – Per Barrel (Excluding Hedging) United States North Dakota$91.26 $59.90 $33.87 Offshore91.51 64.77 36.55 Total United States91.32 61.05 34.63 Guyana96.52 71.07 37.40 Malaysia and JDA89.77 71.00 37.91 Other (b)101.92 69.25 43.42 Worldwide94.15 63.90 35.52 Natural Gas Liquids – Per Barrel United States North Dakota$35.09 $30.74 $11.29 Offshore35.24 26.40 8.94 Worldwide35.09 30.40 11.10 Natural Gas – Per Mcf United States North Dakota$5.50 $4.08 $1.27 Offshore6.21 3.25 1.23 Total United States5.66 3.82 1.26 Malaysia and JDA5.62 5.15 4.47 Other (b)5.93 3.40 3.41 Worldwide5.64 4.60 2.98 (a)Selling prices in the United States and Guyana are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in Marketing expenses.

For 2023, we have hedged 80,000 bopd with WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $70 per barrel, and 10,000 bopd with Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $75 per barrel. We expect option premium amortization, which will be reflected in realized selling prices, to reduce our results by approximately $30 million in the first quarter and by approximately $140 million for the full year 2023.31Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 202220212020 (In thousands)Crude Oil – Barrels United States North Dakota75 80 107 Offshore (a)22 29 38 Total United States97 109 145 Guyana78 30 20 Malaysia and JDA4 3 4 Other (b)15 21 9 Total194 163 178 Natural Gas Liquids – Barrels United States North Dakota53 49 56 Offshore (a)2 4 5 Total United States55 53 61 Natural Gas – Mcf United States North Dakota156 162 180 Offshore (a)44 72 76 Total United States200 234 256 Malaysia and JDA360 347 291 Other (b)10 10 7 Total570 591 554 Barrels of Oil Equivalent344 315 331 Crude oil and natural gas liquids as a share of total production72 %69 %72 %(a)In November 2020, we sold our working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production from the Shenzi Field was 9,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2020.(b)Other includes our interests in Libya (sold in November 2022) and Denmark (sold in August 2021). Net production from Libya was 17,000 boepd for 2022 (2021: 20,000 boepd; 2020: 4,000 boepd). Net production from Denmark was 3,000 boepd for 2021 and 6,000 boepd for 2020. In 2023, we expect net production to be in the range of 355,000 boepd to 365,000 boepd, compared with 2022 net production of 327,000 boepd, proforma for assets sold.Net production variances related to 2022 and 2021 are summarized as follows:United States: North Dakota net production was lower in 2022 by 2,000 boepd primarily due to unplanned production shut-ins caused by severe winter weather partially offset by increased wells on-line. Total offshore net production was lower in 2022 primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells, Penn State, and Llano Fields.International: Net production in Guyana was higher in 2022 primarily due to production ramp up from the Liza Unity FPSO, which commenced production in February 2022 and reached its expected production capacity of 220,000 gross bopd in July 2022. Net production from Guyana included 7,000 bopd of tax barrels in 2022. There were no tax barrels in 2021.32Sales Volumes: Higher sales volumes in 2022 increased after-tax earnings by approximately $490 million. Net worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, which excludes sales volumes of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas purchased from third parties, were as follows: 202220212020 (In thousands)Crude oil – barrels (a)69,679 63,540 60,924 Natural gas liquids – barrels19,843 19,406 22,397 Natural gas – mcf208,001 215,589 202,917 Barrels of Oil Equivalent124,189 118,878 117,141 Crude oil – barrels per day191 174 167 Natural gas liquids – barrels per day54 53 61 Natural gas – mcf per day570 591 554 Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day340 326 320 (a)Sales volumes in 2021 include 4.2 million barrels of crude oil that were stored on VLCCs at December 31, 2020 and sold in the first quarter of 2021.Marketing, including purchased oil and gas (Marketing expense): Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, primarily in the U.S., and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. and Guyana marketing activities. Marketing expense was higher in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher third party crude oil volumes purchased and higher prices paid for purchased volumes. Marketing expense in 2021 included $173 million related to the cost of 4.2 million barrels of crude oil stored on two VLCCs in 2020 that were sold in 2021.Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs consist of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses. Cash operating costs increased primarily due to the production ramp up in Guyana from the Liza Unity FPSO, higher production and severance taxes associated with higher crude oil prices, increased maintenance activity in North Dakota, and higher workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico. On a per-unit basis, cash operating costs in 2022 reflect the higher costs partially offset by the impact of the higher production volumes compared with 2021.Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense increased from 2021, primarily due to higher throughput volumes and minimum volume commitments in 2022. In 2023, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $1,230 million to $1,250 million.DD&A Expense: DD&A expense and per-unit rates were higher in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher production from Guyana following the startup of Liza Phase 2 in February 2022.Unit Costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P net production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed on page 34. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: ActualForecast range 2022202120202023Cash operating costs (a)$13.28 $11.55 $9.91 $13.50 — $14.50DD&A expense (b)12.13 11.84 15.80 $13.00 — $14.00Total Production Unit Costs$25.41 $23.39 $25.71 $26.50 — $28.50(a)Cash operating costs per boe, excluding Libya, were $13.77 in 2022 (2021: $12.11; 2020: $9.85). (b)DD&A expense per boe, excluding Libya, was $12.59 in 2022 (2021: $12.43; 2020: $15.98).Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows:202220212020 (In millions)Exploratory dry hole costs (a)$56 $11 $192 Exploration lease impairment20 20 51 Geological and geophysical expense and exploration overhead132 131 108 $208 $162 $351 (a)Dry hole costs primarily related to the Fish/Tarpon-1 well and Banjo-1 well in 2022 and the Koebi-1 well in 2021 at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In 2020, dry hole costs primarily related to the Tanager-1 well in the Kaieteur Block, offshore Guyana, the Galapagos Deep and Oldfield-1 wells in the Gulf of Mexico and the write-off of previously capitalized exploratory wells (see Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below).In 2023, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million.33Income Taxes: In 2022, E&P income tax expense was $1,072 million compared with income tax expense of $585 million in 2021, primarily due to higher pre-tax income in Libya and Guyana. Income tax expense from Libya operations was $527 million in 2022 compared with $436 million in 2021. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the United States (non-Midstream) and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of GAAP.On August 16, 2022 the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes a 15% book-income alternative minimum tax on corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over $1 billion for any 3-year period ending with 2022 or later and a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock that is repurchased by publicly traded U.S. corporations. The alternative minimum tax and the excise tax are effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The alternative minimum tax is designed to be a temporary acceleration of cash tax as amounts paid under such regime are creditable against the regular U.S. corporate income tax liability in following tax years. The impact of the excise tax provision will be reflected as a component of the cost of the repurchased shares and will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. We continue to evaluate the corporate alternative minimum tax and its potential impact on our future U.S. tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate, as well as any other impacts the IRA may have on our financial position and results of operations.Actual effective tax rates are as follows: 202220212020 %%%Effective income tax benefit (expense) rate(31)(43)—Adjusted effective income tax benefit (expense) rate (a)(19)(15)(5)(a)Excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings.In 2023, we estimate E&P income tax expense, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of $590 million to $600 million.Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense): Before Income TaxesAfter Income Taxes 202220212020202220212020 (In millions)Impairment and other$(54)$(147)$(2,126)$(54)$(147)$(2,049)Dry hole and lease impairment expenses— — (152)— — (150)Crude oil inventories write-down— — (53)— — (52)Severance costs— — (26)— — (26)Gains on asset sales, net76 29 79 76 29 79 $22 $(118)$(2,278)$22 $(118)$(2,198)The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income are as follows: Before Income Taxes202220212020 (In millions)Gains on asset sales, net$76 $29 $79 Marketing, including purchased oil and gas— — (53)Operating costs and expenses— — (20)Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment— — (153)General and administrative expenses— — (5)Impairment and other(54)(147)(2,126) $22 $(118)$(2,278)2022:•Gains on asset sales, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $76 million ($76 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interest in the Waha Concession in Libya.•Impairment and other: We recorded charges of $28 million ($28 million after income taxes) that resulted from updates to our estimated abandonment liabilities for non-producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and $26 million ($26 million after 34income taxes) related to the Penn State Field in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.2021:•Gains on asset sales, net: We recognized a pre-tax gain of $29 million ($29 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in Denmark.•Impairment and other: We recorded a charge of $147 million ($147 million after income taxes) in connection with estimated abandonment obligations in the West Delta Field in the Gulf of Mexico. These abandonment obligations were assigned to us as a former owner after they were discharged from Fieldwood as part of Fieldwood's approved bankruptcy plan. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.2020:•Impairment and other: We recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $2.1 billion ($2.0 billion after income taxes) related to our oil and gas properties at North Malay Basin in Malaysia, the South Arne Field in Denmark, and the Stampede and Tubular Bells Fields in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. Other charges totaling $21 million pre-tax ($20 million after income taxes) related to drilling rig right-of-use assets in the Bakken and surplus materials and supplies. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Dry hole and lease impairment expenses: We incurred pre-tax charges totaling $152 million ($150 million after income taxes) in the first quarter to write-off previously capitalized exploratory well costs of $125 million ($123 million after income taxes) primarily related to the northern portion of the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico and to impair certain exploration leasehold costs by $27 million ($27 million after income taxes) due to a reprioritization of our capital program.•Crude oil inventories write-down: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $53 million ($52 million after income taxes) to adjust crude oil inventories to their net realizable value at the end of the first quarter following the significant decline in crude oil prices.•Severance costs: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $26 million ($26 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits incurred related to cost reduction initiatives.•Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $79 million ($79 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.MidstreamFollowing is a summarized statement of income for our Midstream operations: 202220212020 (In millions)Revenues and Non-Operating Income Sales and other operating revenues$1,273 $1,204 $1,092 Other, net8 10 10 Total revenues and non-operating income1,281 1,214 1,102 Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses280 289 338 General and administrative expenses23 22 21 Depreciation, depletion and amortization181 166 157 Interest expense150 105 95 Total costs and expenses634 582 611 Results of Operations Before Income Taxes647 632 491 Provision (benefit) for income taxes27 15 7 Net income (loss)620 617 484 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests351 331 254 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$269 $286 $230 Sales and other operating revenues increased from 2021 primarily due to higher throughput volumes and minimum volume commitments. Operating costs and expenses decreased primarily due to a planned maintenance turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant in 2021, partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenditures on expanded infrastructure in 2022. DD&A expense increased from 2021 primarily due to additional assets placed in service. Interest expense increased from 2021 primarily due to the $400 million of 5.500% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued in April 2022 and the $750 million of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes issued in August 2021.35Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $255 million to $265 million in 2023.Corporate, Interest and OtherThe following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 202220212020 (In millions)Corporate and other expenses (excluding items affecting comparability)$124 $121 $114 Interest expense353 376 373 Less: Capitalized interest(10)— — Interest expense, net343 376 373 Corporate, Interest and Other expenses before income taxes467 497 487 Provision (benefit) for income taxes— — (6)Corporate, Interest and Other expenses after income taxes467 497 481 Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, after income taxes102 — 1 Total Corporate, Interest and Other Expenses After Income Taxes$569 $497 $482 Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were higher in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher legal and professional fees partially offset by higher interest income. Interest expense, net was lower in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the repayment of the Corporation's $1.0 billion term loan, and capitalized interest that commenced upon sanctioning of the Yellowtail development in Guyana in April 2022.In 2023, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million. Interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $305 million to $315 million in 2023.Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense):2022:•Gains on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of real property related to our former downstream business.•Litigation costs: We incurred pre-tax charges totaling $124 million ($124 million after income taxes) for litigation related costs associated with our former downstream business, HONX, Inc., which are included in General and administrative expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. See Note 17, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments and Note 20, Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.2020:•Severance costs: We incurred a pre-tax charge of $1 million ($1 million after income taxes) for employee termination benefits related to cost reduction initiatives.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 20222021 (In millions, except ratio)Cash and cash equivalents (a)$2,486 $2,713 Current portion of long-term debt3 517 Total debt (b)8,281 8,458 Total equity8,496 7,026 Debt to capitalization ratio for debt covenants (c)36.1 %42.3 %(a)Includes $4 million of cash attributable to our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2022 (2021: $2 million) of which, $3 million is held by Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2022 (2021: $2 million).(b)Includes $2,886 million of debt outstanding from our Midstream Segment at December 31, 2022 (2021: $2,564 million) that is non-recourse to Hess Corporation.(c)Total Consolidated Debt of Hess Corporation (including finance leases and excluding Midstream non-recourse debt) as a percentage of Total Capitalization of Hess Corporation as defined under Hess Corporation's revolving credit facility financial covenants.

See Note 7, Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.36Cash FlowsThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 202220212020 (In millions)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,944 $2,890 $1,333 Investing activities(2,555)(1,325)(1,707)Financing activities(1,616)(591)568 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents$(227)$974 $194 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,944 million in 2022 (2021: $2,890 million), while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $5,121 million in 2022 (2021: $2,991 million). Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased from 2021 primarily due to higher realized selling prices and higher sales volumes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2022 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by $1,177 million (2021: $101 million) reflecting payments of approximately $470 million for accrued Libyan income tax and royalties at December 31, 2021, premiums paid for crude oil hedge contracts, payments for abandonment activities, and the purchase of REDD+ carbon credits.Investing Activities: Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment were $2,725 million in 2022 (2021: $1,747 million). The increase is primarily due to higher drilling and development activities in Guyana, the Bakken, Malaysia and JDA, and the Gulf of Mexico. Proceeds from asset sales were $178 million in 2022 (2021: $427 million).Financing Activities: In 2022, we paid $630 million for settled common stock repurchases (2021: nil) and $465 million for common stock dividends (2021: $311 million). In 2021, we repaid $500 million of our $1 billion term loan, and in 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million. In 2022, we received net proceeds of $146 million from the public offering of Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP (2021: $178 million). Borrowings in 2022 resulted from the issuance by HESM Opco of $400 million of 5.500% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 while borrowings in 2021 related to the issuance by HESM Opco of $750 million of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030. Net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were $510 million in 2022 (2021: $664 million).Future Capital Requirements and ResourcesAt December 31, 2022, we had $2.48 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $5.7 billion. We plan to return up to 75% of our annual adjusted free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and adjusted for debt repayments and net Midstream financing activities) to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. In March 2022, we announced a 50% increase to our quarterly dividend on common stock, and in 2022, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares of common stock for $650 million ($20 million was paid subsequent to December 31, 2022). At December 31, 2022, we have fully utilized our Board authorized common stock repurchase program.Net production in 2023 is forecast to be in the range of 355,000 boepd to 365,000 boepd, and we expect our 2023 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $3.7 billion, up from $2.7 billion in 2022. In 2023, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund our capital investment and capital return programs. Depending on market conditions, we may take any of the following steps, or a combination thereof, to improve our liquidity and financial position: reduce the planned capital program and other cash outlays, including dividends, pursue asset sales, borrow against our committed revolving credit facility, or issue debt or equity securities.37The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2022:Expiration DateCapacityBorrowingsLetters ofCreditIssuedTotalUsedAvailableCapacity (In millions)Hess Corporation Revolving credit facilityJuly 2027$3,250 $— $— $— $3,250 Uncommitted linesVarious (a)83 — 83 83 — Total – Hess Corporation $3,333 $— $83 $83 $3,250 Midstream Revolving credit facility (b)July 2027$1,000 $18 $— $18 $982 Total – Midstream $1,000 $18 $— $18 $982 (a)Uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2023.(b)This credit facility may only be utilized by HESM Opco and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation.Hess Corporation:In July 2022, we replaced our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring in May 2024 with a new $3.25 billion revolving credit facility maturing in July 2027. The new facility, which is fully undrawn, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the new facility will generally bear interest at 1.400% above SOFR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the credit rating of the Corporation's senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. At December 31, 2022, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under its revolving credit facility. In 2020, we entered into a $1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of March 16, 2023. Borrowings under the term loan generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an initial applicable margin of 2.25%. In July 2021, we repaid $500 million of the term loan, and in February 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million.The revolving credit facility is subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15% (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility). The indentures for the Corporation's fixed-rate senior unsecured notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15%. As of December 31, 2022, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants. The most restrictive of the financial covenants relating to our fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and our revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional $2,146 million of secured debt at December 31, 2022.We have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.Midstream:In July 2022, HESM Opco, a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, amended and restated its credit agreement for its $1.4 billion senior secured syndicated credit facilities, consisting of a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $400 million term loan facility. The amended and restated credit agreement, among other things, extended the maturity date from December 2024 to July 2027, increased the accordion feature to up to an additional $750 million, which does not represent a lending commitment from the lenders, and replaced LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate with SOFR. Borrowings under the term loan facility will generally bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.650% to 2.550%, while the applicable margin for the syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.375% to 2.050%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of the assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2022, borrowings of $18 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s Term Loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation.38Credit RatingsAll three major credit rating agencies that rate the senior unsecured debt of Hess Corporation have assigned an investment grade credit rating. In June 2022, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our senior unsecured ratings from Ba1 to Baa3 with a stable outlook. In March 2022, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed our credit rating at BBB- with stable outlook. Fitch Ratings affirmed our BBB- credit rating with a positive outlook in August 2022.At December 31, 2022, HESM Opco’s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, and Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service.Cash Requirements: Our cash obligations and commitments over the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt, interest, lease payments, and purchase obligations which cover a portion of our planned capital expenditure program in 2023 and include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, carbon credits, transportation and related contracts, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses.Our long-term cash obligations and commitments include:•Debt and interest: See Note 7, Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. •Operating and finance leases: The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs, equipment, logistical assets (offshore vessels, aircraft, and shorebases), and office space for varying periods. See Note 6, Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Purchase obligations: We were contractually committed at December 31, 2022 for certain long-term capital expenditures and operating expenses. Long-term obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, transportation and related contracts, carbon credits, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. See Note 17, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Asset retirement obligations: See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Post-retirement plan liabilities: We have certain unfunded post-retirement plans, including our post-retirement medical plan. See Note 9, Retirement Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.•Uncertain income tax positions: See Note 14, Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsSee Note 17, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Foreign OperationsWe conduct E&P activities outside the U.S., principally in Guyana, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand, Malaysia, Suriname, and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesAccounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations 39for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E&P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets.For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year.Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were $94.13 per barrel for WTI (2021: $66.34) and $97.98 per barrel for Brent (2021: $68.92). At December 31, 2022, spot prices closed at $80.26 per barrel for WTI and $81.33 per barrel for Brent. If crude oil prices in 2023 are at levels below that used in determining 2022 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2023 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2023 above those used in determining 2022 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2023. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2023, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2023 crude oil prices, the amount of any additions to proved reserves, positive or negative revisions in proved reserves related to 2023 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2023 crude oil prices, and management’s plans as of December 31, 2023 for developing proved undeveloped reserves. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2022 would result in an approximate $175 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2023 based on projected production volumes. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 87 through 96 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves.Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements.In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.Our impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. We could experience an impairment in the future if one or a combination of the following occur: the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the economic slowdown from COVID-19, we reviewed our oil and gas fields and midstream operating segment asset groups for impairment at March 31, 2020. We impaired various oil and gas fields located in Malaysia, Denmark, and the Gulf of Mexico in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. See Note 12, Impairment and Other in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.40Hess Midstream LP: We consolidate the activities of our interest in Hess Midstream LP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through Hess Corporation’s approximate 41% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered Hess Midstream LP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between Hess Midstream LP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of Hess Midstream LP.Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. We remained in a recent cumulative loss position in the United States (non-Midstream) and Malaysia at December 31, 2022. A recent cumulative loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the United States (non-Midstream), and Malaysia, while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions.At December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $3,658 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence. There is a reasonable possibility that if anticipated future earnings come to fruition and no other unforeseen negative evidence materializes, sufficient positive evidence may become available to support the release of all or a portion of the Company's valuation allowance in these jurisdictions in the near term. This would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the release is recorded.Asset Retirement Obligations: We have legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E&P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations.Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. The most significant assumptions relate to:41Discount rates used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost: The discount rates used to estimate our projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. At December 31, 2022, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate assumptions would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately $65 million and would increase forecasted 2023 annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately $2 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligations would decrease the funded status of our pension plans, but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios.Expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets: The expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of plan assets to that asset category. The future expected rate of return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. At December 31, 2022, a 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2023 annual net periodic benefit expense by approximately $5 million.Other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and expected participant mortality.Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for financial assets, and our credit is considered for financial liabilities.We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.Environment, Health and SafetyOur long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our EHS & SR policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives.Environmental MattersWe recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. The EPA has adopted a series of GHG monitoring, reporting, and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting further legislation to reduce GHG emissions. For example, in November 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of 42performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The EPA issued a supplemental proposed rule on November 15, 2022, which provided additional information, including regulatory text, about the November 2021 proposed rule. The supplemental proposed rule would impose more stringent requirements than are currently applicable on the natural gas and oil industry. In addition, the IRA includes a methane emissions reduction program for petroleum and natural gas systems, which requires the EPA to impose a “waste emissions charge” on excess methane emissions from certain natural gas and oil sources that are required to report under EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program beginning January 1, 2024 and also provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of competing low carbon energy production methods. Furthermore, states have taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. At the international level, the Paris Agreement on climate change aimed to enhance global response to global temperature changes and to reduce GHG emissions, among other things. We are committed to complying with all GHG emissions regulations that apply to our operations, including those related to venting or flaring of natural gas, and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. While we monitor climate-related regulatory initiatives and international public policy issues, the current state of ongoing international climate initiatives and any related domestic actions make it difficult to assess the timing or effect on our operations or to predict with certainty the future costs that we may incur in order to comply with future international treaties, legislation or new regulations. However, future restrictions on emissions of GHGs, or related measures to encourage use of low carbon energy could result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products, as described under Regulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include E&P facilities, sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and, although not currently significant, EPA “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. For additional information, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. At December 31, 2022, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $55 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $23 million in 2022 (2021: $16 million; 2020: $15 million). The amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.As an element of our EHS and SR strategy, we purchase carbon credits annually to offset 100 percent of our estimated Scope 3 business travel emissions and 100 percent of our estimated Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions associated with operating the Corporation’s truck fleet, aviation activities (aircraft and helicopters) and personal and rental vehicle miles driven on company business. We also offset purchased electricity used in our operations from nonrenewable sources by purchasing renewable energy certificates. The cost of these purchased and retired renewable energy certificates was not material to our financial results in 2022 and was included in Operating costs and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. In December 2022, we announced an agreement with the Government of Guyana to purchase 37.5 million REDD+ carbon credits, including current and future issuances, for a minimum of $750 million from 2022 through 2032 to prevent deforestation and support sustainable development in Guyana. These credits will be on the ART Registry and will be independently verified to represent permanent and additional emissions reductions under ART's REDD+ Environmental Standard 2.0 (TREES). This agreement adds to the Corporation's ongoing emissions reduction efforts and is an important part of our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis by 2050. In December 2022, we purchased 5 million REDD+ carbon credits registered on the ART Registry for $75 million under this agreement, which is included in non-current Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Health and Safety MattersThe crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels regarding the health and safety of E&P operations. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other matters, occupational safety, the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production, well control and integrity, process safety and equipment integrity, and may include permitting and disclosure requirements, operating restrictions and other conditions on the development of crude oil and natural gas. The level of our expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country health and safety regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. While compliance with laws and regulations relating to health and safety matters increases the overall cost of business for us and the oil and gas industry in general, it has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or results of operations. Occupational Safety: We are subject to the requirements set forth under federal workplace standards by the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. Under OSHA and other federal and state occupational safety and health laws and laws of foreign countries in which we operate, we must develop, maintain and disclose certain information about hazardous materials used, released, or produced in our operations. 43Production and Well Integrity: Our U.S. onshore production facilities are subject to U.S. federal government, state and local regulations regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing and well control and integrity. Our offshore production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico are subject to the U.S. federal government’s Safety and Environmental Management System regulations, which provide a systematic approach for identifying, managing and mitigating hazards. Adapting to new technical standards and procedures in production and in our well integrity management system is fundamental to our aim of protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce and the communities in which we operate, and to safeguarding our product.Process Safety and Equipment Integrity: We are also regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels regarding process safety and the integrity of our equipment, including OSHA’s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard. ICE are barriers and safeguards that prevent or mitigate process safety incidents through detection, isolation, containment, control or emergency preparedness and response within our facilities. We have established ICE performance standards, which set specific requirements and criteria for inspections and tests that help to ensure ICE barriers are effective. We conduct assessments collaboratively with our operated assets, subject matter experts and technical authorities to evaluate compliance with corporate and asset environment, health and safety standards and procedures, as well as with applicable regulations. For additional information on our emergency response and incident mitigation activities, see Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures in Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties. 44Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskIn the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities.Controls: We maintain a control environment under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Controls over instruments used in financial risk management activities include volumetric and term limits. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Instruments: We primarily use forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, and options in our risk management activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how we use them:•Swaps: We use financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of our financial risk management activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract.•Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: We enter into forward contracts, primarily for the British Pound and Malaysian Ringgit, which commit us to buy or sell a fixed amount of those currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date.•Exchange-traded Contracts: We may use exchange-traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits.•Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange-traded and third-party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a purchaser of options, we pay a premium at the outset and are exposed to the favorable consequence of collecting payment upon exercise depending upon the underlying commodity price movement. As a seller of options, we receive a premium at the outset and are exposed to the unfavorable consequence of having to make payment upon exercise depending upon the underlying commodity price movement.Financial Risk Management ActivitiesWe have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $177 million at December 31, 2022 that are used to reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies. The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain or loss of approximately $20 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022.At December 31, 2022, our total long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments, had a carrying value of $8,281 million and a fair value of $8,192 million. A 15% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately $465 million or $515 million, respectively. Any changes in interest rates do not impact our cash outflows associated with fixed-rate interest payments or settlement of debt principal, unless a debt instrument is repurchased prior to maturity.See Note 19, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.45Item 8.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report, which is included herein.By /s/ John P. Rielly By /s/ John B. Hess John P. RiellyExecutive Vice President andChief Financial Officer John B. HessChief Executive OfficerFebruary 24, 202347Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hess CorporationOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the Corporation) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPNew York, New YorkFebruary 24, 202348Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hess CorporationOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and natural gas propertiesDescription of the Matter The net book value of the Corporation’s exploration and production assets was $11,917 million at December 31, 2022, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $1,520 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, capitalized costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved reserves. Capitalized costs of exploratory wells and development costs are depreciated and depleted on a units-of-production basis based on estimated proved developed reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry based on evaluations of estimated in-place hydrocarbon volumes using financial and non-financial inputs. Significant judgment is required by the Corporation’s internal engineering staff in interpreting the data used to estimate reserves. Estimating proved reserves also requires the selection and evaluation of inputs, including historical production, oil and natural gas price assumptions as well as future operating and capital costs assumptions, among others. Management used independent petroleum engineering specialists to audit approximately 89% of the Corporation's proved reserves at December 31, 2022 as prepared by the Corporation’s internal engineering staff.49 Auditing the Corporation's DD&A expense calculation is especially complex because of the use of the work of the Corporation's internal engineering staff and the independent petroleum engineering specialists and the evaluation of management's determination of the inputs described above used by these engineering specialists in estimating proved oil and gas reserves.How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the DD&A expense calculation. This included controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves. Our testing of the Corporation’s DD&A expense calculation included, among other procedures, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Corporation’s internal petroleum engineering specialist responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s reserve estimates and of the independent petroleum engineering specialist used to audit the estimates. On a sample basis, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing significant inputs to source documentation, where available, and assessing the inputs for reasonableness based on review of corroborative evidence and consideration of any contrary evidence. Additionally, we performed analytic and lookback procedures on select inputs into the oil and gas reserve estimate as well as on the outputs. Finally, we tested that the DD&A expense calculations are based on the appropriate proved oil and gas reserve balances from the Corporation’s reserve report./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the

Consolidated Financial Statements.551. Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting PoliciesUnless the context indicates otherwise, references to “Hess”, “the Corporation”, “Registrant”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the consolidated business operations of Hess Corporation and its affiliates.Nature of Business: Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global E&P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), and Malaysia. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada.Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s approximate 41% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2022 (see Note 4, Hess Midstream LP) provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota.Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hess Corporation and entities in which we own more than a 50% voting interest. We consolidate Hess Midstream LP, a variable interest entity, based on our conclusion that we have the power through Hess Corporation’s approximate 41% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. Our undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas E&P ventures are proportionately consolidated. Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned and where we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method.Estimates and Assumptions: In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves, asset and other valuations, depreciable lives, post-retirement liabilities, legal and environmental obligations, asset retirement obligations and income taxes.Revenue Recognition:Exploration and ProductionThe E&P segment recognizes revenue from the sale of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas as performance obligations under contracts with customers are satisfied. Our responsibilities to deliver each unit of quantity of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas under these contracts represent separate, distinct performance obligations. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer. Generally, the control of each unit of quantity transfers to the customer upon the transfer of legal title at the point of physical delivery. Pricing is variable and is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials.For long-term international natural gas contracts with ship-or-pay provisions, our obligation to stand-ready to provide a minimum volume over each commitment period represents separate, distinct performance obligations. Penalties owed against future deliveries of natural gas due to delivery of volumes below minimum delivery commitments are recognized as reductions to revenue in the commitment period when the shortfall occurs. Long-term international natural gas contracts may also contain take-or-pay provisions whereby the customer is required to pay for volumes not taken that are below minimum volume commitments, but the customer has certain make-up rights to receive shortfall volumes in subsequent periods. Shortfall payments received from customers when volumes purchased are below the minimum volume commitment are deferred upon receipt as a contract liability. Revenue is recognized at the earlier of when we deliver the make-up volumes in subsequent periods or when it becomes remote that the customer will exercise their make-up rights.Certain crude oil, NGL, and natural gas volumes are purchased by Hess from third parties, including working interest partners and royalty owners in certain Hess-operated properties, before they are sold to customers. Where control over the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas transfers to Hess before the volumes are transferred to the customer, revenue and the associated cost of purchased volumes are presented on a gross basis in the Statement of Consolidated Income within Sales and other operating revenues and Marketing, including purchased oil and gas, respectively. Where control of crude oil, NGL, or natural gas is not transferred to Hess, revenue is presented net of the associated cost of purchased volumes within Sales and other operating revenues in the Statement of Consolidated Income.56Contract Duration and Pricing:Contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. crude oil, NGL, and natural gas primarily include those contracts that involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period, and those contracts that automatically renew on a periodic basis until either party cancels. We have certain long-term contracts with customers for the sale of U.S. natural gas and NGL that have remaining durations ranging from one to ten years. Contracts with customers for the sale of international crude oil involve the short-term sale of volumes during a specified period. Pricing is determined with reference to a particular market or pricing index, plus or minus adjustments reflecting quality or location differentials, shortly after control of the volumes transfers to the customer. International contracts with customers for the sale of natural gas are in the form of natural gas sales agreements with government entities that have durations that are aligned with the durations of production sharing contracts or other contractual arrangements with host governments. Pricing is determined using contractual formulas that are based on the price of alternative fuels as obtained from price indices and other factors.Contract Balances:Our right to receive or collect payment from the customer is aligned with the timing of revenue recognition except in situations when we receive shortfall payments under contracts with take-or-pay provisions with customer make-up rights. Generally, we receive payments from customers on a monthly basis, shortly after the physical delivery of the crude oil, NGL, or natural gas. At December 31, 2022, contract liabilities of $24 million (2021: $24 million) resulted from a take-or-pay deficiency payment received in 2021 that is subject to a make-up period expiring in December 2023. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no contract assets.Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations:The transaction price allocated to our wholly unsatisfied performance obligations on uncompleted contracts is variable. Further, many of our contracts with customers have durations of less than twelve months. Accordingly, we have elected under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers, the exemption from disclosure of revenue recognizable in future periods as these performance obligations are satisfied.Sales-based Taxes:We exclude sales-based taxes that are collected from customers from the transaction price in our contracts with customers. Accordingly, revenue from contracts with customers is net of sales-based taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities.Revenue from Non-customers:In Guyana, the joint venture partners (Co-Venturers) to the Stabroek Block petroleum agreement are subject to the income tax laws of Guyana and remain primarily liable for income taxes due on the results of operations, resulting in recognition of income tax expense. Pursuant to the contractual arrangements of the petroleum agreement, a portion of gross production from the block, separate from the Co-Venturers’ cost oil and profit oil entitlement, is used to satisfy the Co-Venturers’ income tax liability. This portion of gross production, referred to as tax barrels, is included in our reported production volumes and is recognized as sales revenue from non-customers.MidstreamOur Midstream segment provides gathering, compression, processing, fractionation, storage, terminaling, loading and transportation, and water handling services.The Midstream segment has multiple long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with certain subsidiaries of Hess, each generally with an initial ten-year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. These contracts have minimum volumes the customer is obligated to provide each calendar quarter. The minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation based on nominations covering substantially all of our E&P segment’s production and projected third-party volumes that will be purchased in the Bakken. As the minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation, and as these contracts contain fee inflation escalators and fee recalculation mechanisms, substantially all of the transaction price at contract inception is variable. The Midstream segment also has long-term, fee based commercial agreements for water handling services with a subsidiary of Hess with an initial 14 year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. Water handling services are provided for an agreed-upon fee per barrel or the reimbursement of third-party fees.The Midstream segment’s responsibilities to provide each of the above services for each year under each of the commercial agreements are considered separate, distinct performance obligations. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation under 57these commercial agreements over-time as services are rendered using the output method, measured using the amount of volumes serviced during the period. The Midstream segment has elected the practical expedient under the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers to recognize revenue in the amount it is entitled to invoice. If the commercial agreements have ship-or-pay provisions, the Midstream segment’s responsibility to stand-ready to service a minimum volume over each quarterly commitment period represent separate, distinct performance obligations. Shortfall payments received under ship-or-pay provisions are recognized as revenue in the calendar quarter the shortfall occurs as the customer does not have make-up rights beyond the calendar quarter end of the quarterly commitment period. All revenues, receivables, and contract balances arising from the commercial agreements between the Midstream segment and the Hess subsidiaries that are the counterparty to the commercial agreements are eliminated upon consolidation.On December 30, 2020, Hess Midstream exercised its renewal options to extend the terms of certain gas gathering, crude oil gathering, gas processing and fractionation, storage, and terminal and export commercial agreements for the secondary term through December 31, 2033. There were no changes to any provisions of the existing commercial agreements as a result of the exercise of the renewal options.Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors, firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: We record depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production facilities and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.Capitalized Interest: Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field. Capitalized interest is depreciated in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets.Impairment of Long‑lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is measured based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements.In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a projected amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows reported in Supplementary Oil and Gas Data, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.Impairment of Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1st or when events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over fair value, limited by the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2022, goodwill of $360 million relates to the Midstream operating segment.Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents primarily comprises cash on hand and on deposit, as well as highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired.58Inventories: Produced and unsold crude oil and NGL are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost of production plus any transport cost incurred in bringing the volumes to their present location. Materials and supplies are valued at cost. Obsolete or surplus materials identified during periodic reviews are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.Leases: We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception by evaluating whether the contract conveys the right to control an identified asset during the period of use. ROU assets represent our right to use an identified asset for the lease term and lease obligations represent our obligation to make payments as set forth in the lease arrangement. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as operating leases or finance leases at the commencement date based on the present value of the minimum lease payments over the lease term. Where the implicit discount rate in a lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date for determining the present value of the minimum lease payments. The lease term used in measurement of our lease obligations includes options to extend or terminate the lease when, in our judgment, it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the measurement of lease obligations using the index or rate at the commencement date. Variable lease payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances after the commencement date of the lease are not included in the minimum lease payments used to measure lease obligations. We have agreements that include financial obligations for lease and nonlease components. For purposes of measuring lease obligations, we have elected not to separate nonlease components from lease components for the following classes of assets: drilling rigs, office space, offshore vessels, and aircraft. We apply a portfolio approach to account for operating lease ROU assets and liabilities for certain vehicles, railcars, field equipment and office equipment leases.Finance lease cost is recognized as amortization of the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. Operating lease cost is generally recognized on a straight-line basis. Operating lease costs for drilling rigs used to drill development wells and successful exploration wells are capitalized. Operating lease cost for other ROU assets used in oil and gas producing activities are either capitalized or expensed on a straight-line basis based on the nature of operation for which the ROU asset is utilized.Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as permitted under ASC 842, Leases. We recognize lease cost for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Some of our leases with initial terms of 12 months or less include one or more options to renew. The renewal option is at our sole discretion and is not included in the lease term for measurement of the lease obligation unless we are reasonably certain at the commencement date of the lease, to renew the lease.Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method. We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. We assign cumulative historical losses significant weight in the evaluation of realizability relative to more subjective evidence such as forecasts of future income. In addition, we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. We are no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to the book in excess of tax basis in the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. Because of U.S. tax reform we expect that the future reversal of such temporary differences will occur free of material taxation. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. We account for the U.S. tax effect of global intangible low-taxed income earned by foreign subsidiaries in the period that such income is earned. We utilize the aggregate approach for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Asset Retirement Obligations: We have legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or the seabed at certain E&P locations. We initially recognize a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred and capitalize the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long‑lived assets. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted over the useful life of the related asset, and the capitalized asset retirement costs are depreciated over proved developed oil and gas reserves using the units of production method or the useful life of the related asset. Fair value is determined by applying a credit adjusted risk-free rate to the undiscounted expected future abandonment expenditures. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Income.59We measure asset retirement obligations based on the requirements of existing laws and regulations in accordance with ASC 410-20, Asset Retirement Obligations. Laws and regulations associated with the scope and timing for the abandonment of oil and gas wells, facilities and equipment could change which could increase the cost of our abandonment obligations. In addition, we may be required to assume abandonment obligations for certain divested assets in the event the current or future owners of facilities previously owned by us are unable to perform, whether due to bankruptcy or otherwise.Retirement Plans: We recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. We recognize the net changes in the funded status of these plans as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the year in which such changes occur. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the remaining average expected life if a plan’s participants are predominantly inactive.Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments for financial risk management activities. In these activities, we may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for financial assets, and our credit is considered for financial liabilities. We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by GAAP. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying nonmonetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long‑lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value; however, the level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows:Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity.Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over-the-counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange-traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded contracts.Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3.Netting of Financial Instruments: We generally enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate legal and counterparty credit risk. Master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty, commonly known as the “safe harbor” provisions. If a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterparty’s bankruptcy, these rights are generally enforceable with respect to “safe harbor” transactions. If these arrangements provide the right of offset and our intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination, our policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis. In the normal course of business, we rely on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses 60providing for adequate credit assurance as well as close‑out netting, including two‑party netting and single counterparty multilateral netting. As applied to us, “two‑party netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single Hess entity, and “single counterparty multilateral netting” is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple Hess entities. We are reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.Share-based Compensation: We account for share-based compensation based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value of all share‑based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting terms, net of actual forfeitures. We estimate fair value at the date of grant using a Black‑Scholes valuation model for employee stock options and a Monte Carlo simulation model for performance share units (PSUs). Fair value of restricted stock is based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant.Foreign Currency Remeasurement: The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency (primary currency in which business is conducted) for our foreign operations. Adjustments resulting from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.Maintenance and Repairs: Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capital improvements are recorded as additions in Property, plant and equipment.Environmental Expenditures: We accrue and expense the undiscounted environmental costs necessary to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year‑end 2022, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $55 million. Environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment are capitalized. The cost of REDD+ carbon credits are recorded in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and will be expensed when retired to offset emissions.2.

At December 31, 2022, 36 exploration and appraisal wells on the Stabroek Block, with a total cost of $732 million, were capitalized pending determination of proved reserves. Other additions to capitalized exploratory wells costs in 2022 included the Huron-1 well (Hess 40%) in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Zanderij-1 well on Block 42 (Hess 33%), offshore Suriname.Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves in 2022 resulted from the sanction of the Yellowtail Field development, the fourth sanctioned project on the Stabroek Block. In 2020, reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment resulted from sanctions of the Payara Field development, the third sanctioned project on the Stabroek Block, and an additional phase of development at the North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia.Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense in 2020 of $125 million primarily related to the northern portion of the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) in the Gulf of Mexico. The preceding table excludes well costs incurred and expensed during 2022 of $56 million (2021: $11 million; 2020: $67 million).Exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling were $585 million at December 31, 2022, separated by year of completion as follows (in millions):2021$222 202054 2019140 2018105 2017 and prior64 $585 Guyana: Approximately 91% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relate to successful exploration and appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were encountered on the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%). In the fourth quarter of 2022, the operator submitted a development plan for the Uaru Field, the fifth development project on the Stabroek Block, to the Government of Guyana for approval. The operator also plans further appraisal drilling on the block and is conducting pre-development planning for additional phases of development.JDA: Approximately 7% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the JDA (Hess 50%) in the Gulf of Thailand, where hydrocarbons were encountered in three successful exploration wells drilled in the western part of Block A-18. The operator has submitted a development plan concept to the regulator to facilitate ongoing commercial negotiations for an extension of the existing gas sales contract to include development of the western part of the block.Malaysia: Approximately 2% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to North Malay Basin (Hess 50%), offshore Peninsular Malaysia, where hydrocarbons were encountered in one successful exploration well. Pre-development studies are ongoing.4. Hess Midstream LPIn December 2019, Hess Midstream Partners’ organizational structure converted from a master limited partnership into an “Up-C” structure in which Hess Midstream Partners’ public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares in a new public entity named Hess Midstream LP (Hess Midstream), which is taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Hess Midstream Partners changed its name to “Hess Midstream Operations LP” (HESM Opco) and became a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream, the new publicly listed entity. As consideration for the acquisition, Hess and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) each received a cash payment of $301 million and approximately 115 million newly issued HESM Opco Class B units. After giving effect to the acquisition and related transactions, public shareholders of Class A shares in Hess Midstream owned 6% of the 62consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis and Hess and GIP each owned 47% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis, primarily through their ownership of Class B units in HESM Opco that are exchangeable into Class A shares of Hess Midstream on a one-for-one basis.In March 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of 6.9 million Hess Midstream Class A shares held by Hess and GIP. Hess received net proceeds of $70 million from the public offering. The transaction resulted in an increase in Capital in excess of par and Noncontrolling interests of $56 million and $41 million, respectively. The increase to Noncontrolling interests of $41 million is comprised of $14 million resulting from the change in ownership interest and $27 million from an increase to deferred tax assets resulting from a change in the difference between the carrying amount and tax basis of Hess Midstream's investment in HESM Opco.In August 2021, HESM Opco repurchased 31.25 million HESM Opco Class B units held by Hess and GIP for $750 million. HESM Opco issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to finance the repurchase. The transaction resulted in an increase in Capital in excess of par and a decrease in Noncontrolling interests of $28 million, and an increase in deferred tax assets and Noncontrolling interests of $15 million resulting from a change in the difference between the carrying amount and tax basis of Hess Midstream's investment in HESM Opco. The $375 million paid to GIP reduced Noncontrolling interests.In October 2021, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of approximately 8.6 million Hess Midstream Class A Shares held by Hess and GIP. Hess received net proceeds of $108 million from the public offering. The transaction resulted in an increase in Capital in excess of par and Noncontrolling interests of $96 million and $62 million, respectively. The increase to Noncontrolling interests of $62 million is comprised of $12 million resulting from the change in ownership interest and $50 million from an increase to deferred tax assets resulting from a change in the difference between the carrying amount and tax basis of Hess Midstream's investment in HESM Opco.In April 2022, Hess Midstream completed an underwritten public equity offering of approximately 10.2 million Hess Midstream Class A shares held by Hess and GIP. Hess received net proceeds of $146 million from the public offering. The transaction resulted in an increase in Capital in excess of par and Noncontrolling interests of $130 million and $88 million, respectively. The increase to Noncontrolling interests of $88 million is comprised of $16 million resulting from the change in ownership interest and $72 million from an increase to deferred tax assets resulting from a change in the difference between the carrying amount and tax basis of Hess Midstream's investment in HESM Opco.Concurrent with the April 2022 public offering, HESM Opco repurchased approximately 13.6 million HESM Opco Class B units held by Hess and GIP for $400 million. HESM Opco issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due 2030 in a private offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility used to finance the repurchase. The transaction resulted in an increase in Capital in excess of par and a decrease in Noncontrolling interests of $32 million, and an increase in deferred tax assets and Noncontrolling interests of $17 million resulting from a change in the difference between the carrying amount and tax basis of Hess Midstream's investment in HESM Opco. The $200 million paid to GIP reduced Noncontrolling interests.After giving effect to the above transactions in 2022 and 2021, public shareholders of Class A shares of Hess Midstream own approximately 18%, and Hess and GIP each own approximately 41%, of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis at December 31, 2022.Little Missouri 4 (LM4) is a 200 million standard cubic feet per day gas processing plant located south of the Missouri River in McKenzie County, North Dakota, that was constructed as part of a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Midstream and Targa Resources Corp. Hess Midstream has a natural gas processing agreement with LM4 under which it pays a processing fee and reimburses LM4 for its proportionate share of electricity costs. In 2022, processing fees were $21 million (2021: $28 million; 2020: $26 million) and are included in Operating costs and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.At December 31, 2022, Hess Midstream liabilities totaling $3,027 million (2021: $2,694 million) are on a nonrecourse basis to Hess Corporation, while Hess Midstream assets available to settle the obligations of Hess Midstream included cash and cash equivalents totaling $3 million (2021: $2 million), property, plant and equipment, net totaling $3,173 million (2021: $3,125 million) and the equity-method investment in LM4 of $94 million (2021: $102 million).635.

Where we have contracted directly with a lessor in our role as operator of an unincorporated oil and gas venture, we bill our partners their proportionate share for reimbursements as payments under lease agreements become due pursuant to the terms of our joint operating and other agreements.The nature of our leasing arrangements at December 31, 2022 was as follows:Operating leases: In the normal course of business, we primarily lease drilling rigs, equipment, logistical assets (offshore vessels, aircraft, and shorebases), and office space.Finance leases: In 2018, we entered into a sale and lease-back arrangement for a floating storage and offloading vessel (FSO) to handle produced condensate at North Malay Basin, offshore Peninsular Malaysia. At December 31, 2022, the remaining lease term for the FSO was 10.8 years.64Maturities of lease obligations at December 31, 2022 were as follows: Operating LeasesFinanceLeases (In millions)2023$225 $36 2024133 36 202598 36 202683 31 202745 22 Remaining years185 122 Total lease payments (a)769 283 Less: Imputed interest(100)(83)Total lease obligations$669 $200 (a)Excludes lease payments of $153 million under an agreement to lease a deepwater drilling rig to be used in the Gulf of Mexico.

Future short-term lease costs will vary based on activity levels of our operated assets. In 2022, short-term lease cost included drilling rigs and offshore support vessels used for an exploration well and abandonment activity in the Gulf of Mexico and workover rigs for maintenance activities in the Bakken.(b)Variable lease costs for drilling rigs result from differences in the minimum rate and the actual usage of the ROU asset during the lease period. Variable lease costs for logistical assets result from differences in stated monthly rates and total charges reflecting the actual usage of the ROU asset during the lease period. Variable lease costs for our office leases represent common area maintenance charges which have not been separated from lease components.(c)We sublease certain of our office space to third parties under our head lease.The above lease costs represent 100% of the lease payments due for the period, including where we as operator have contracted directly with suppliers. As the payments under lease agreements where we are operator become due, we bill our partners their proportionate share for reimbursement pursuant to the terms of our joint operating agreements. Reimbursements are not reflected in the table above. Certain lease costs above associated with exploration and development activities are included in capital expenditures.65Supplemental cash flow information related to leases were as follows:Operating LeasesFinance Leases202220212020202220212020(In millions)Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease obligations:Operating cash flows (a)$126 $87 $218 $18 $18 $20 Financing cash flows (a)— — — 19 18 17 Noncash transactions:Leased assets recognized for new lease obligations incurred (b)294 12 51 — — — Changes in leased assets and lease obligations due to lease modifications (c)16 29 123 — — — (a)Amounts represent gross lease payments before any recovery from partners.

The indentures for our fixed-rate senior unsecured notes limit the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as that term is defined in the indentures) to 15%. As of December 31, 2022, Hess Corporation was in compliance with this financial covenant.Term loan and credit facility:In March 2020, we entered into a $1 billion three year term loan agreement with a maturity date of March 16, 2023. In July 2021, we repaid $500 million of the $1 billion outstanding under the term loan. In February 2022, we repaid the remaining $500 million, which was classified as Current portion of long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021.In July 2022, Hess Corporation replaced its $3.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring in May 2024 with a new $3.25 billion revolving credit facility maturing in July 2027. The new facility, which is fully undrawn, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the new facility will generally bear interest at 1.400% above SOFR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the credit rating of the Corporation's senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. At December 31, 2022, Hess Corporation had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under this facility.The revolving credit facility is subject to customary representations, warranties, customary events of default and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and a financial covenant limiting the ratio of secured debt to Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 15% (as these capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility). As of December 31, 2022, Hess Corporation was in compliance with these financial covenants.Other outstanding letters of credit at December 31 were as follows: 20222021 (In millions)Committed lines$— $29 Uncommitted lines (a)83 230 Total$83 $259 (a)At December 31, 2022, uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2023.The most restrictive of the financial covenants related to our fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility would allow us to borrow up to an additional $2,146 million of secured debt at December 31, 2022.Debt – Midstream:Senior unsecured fixed-rate public notes: At December 31, 2022, HESM Opco’s fixed-rate senior unsecured notes had a gross principal amount of $2,500 million (2021: $2,100 million) and a weighted average interest rate of 5.1% (2021: 5.0%). HESM Opco's senior unsecured notes are guaranteed by certain of HESM Opco’s direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. These senior unsecured notes are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 67 In April 2022, HESM Opco issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due in 2030 in a private offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility used to finance the repurchase of approximately 13.6 million HESM Opco Class B units held by Hess and GIP. In August 2021, HESM Opco issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes due in 2030 in a private offering to finance the repurchase of 31.25 million HESM Opco Class B units held by Hess and GIP.Credit facilities:In July 2022, HESM Opco amended and restated its credit agreement for its $1.4 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities consisting of a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a fully drawn $400 million term loan facility. The amended and restated credit agreement, among other things, extended the maturity date from December 2024 to July 2027, increased the accordion feature to up to an additional $750 million, which does not represent a lending commitment from the lenders, and replaced LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate with SOFR. Borrowings under the new term loan facility will generally bear interest at SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.650% to 2.550%, while the applicable margin for the new syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.375% to 2.050%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. HESM Opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2022. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of the assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2022, borrowings of $18 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s Term Loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation.8.

In June 2021, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan of Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood), which included the abandonment of certain assets, including seven offshore Gulf of Mexico leases and related facilities in the West Delta Field that were formerly owned by us and sold to a Fieldwood predecessor in 2004, and the discharge of Fieldwood’s obligation to decommission these facilities. Our decommissioning obligation derived from our former ownership of the facilities. Liabilities incurred in 2021 include $147 million representing the estimated abandonment obligations for the West Delta Field. The liabilities settled or disposed of in 2022 primarily result from abandonment activity completed in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken. Liabilities settled or disposed of in 2021 primarily result from the sale of our interests in Denmark and abandonment activity completed in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken. Revisions of estimated liabilities in 2022 primarily reflect changes in service and equipment rates while revisions of estimated liabilities in 2021 primarily reflect an acceleration of planned abandonment activity in the Gulf of Mexico and changes in service and equipment rates.68Sinking fund deposits that are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations, which are reported in non-current Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, were $261 million at December 31, 2022 (2021: $233 million).9. Retirement PlansWe have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a significant portion of our employees. In addition, we have an unfunded supplemental pension plan covering certain employees, which provides incremental payments that would have been payable from our principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary to our U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2017 and to our employees in the United Kingdom (U.K.). The U.S. employees hired on or after January 1, 2017 participate under a cash accumulation formula and receive credits to a notional account based on a percentage of pensionable wages. Interest accrues on the balance in the notional account at a rate determined in accordance with plan provisions. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded postretirement medical plan that provides health benefits to certain U.S. qualified retirees from ages 55 through 65. The measurement date for all retirement plans is December 31.The following table summarizes the benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of our pension and postretirement medical plans:FundedPension PlansUnfundedPension PlanPostretirementMedical Plan 202220212022202120222021 (In millions)Change in Benefit Obligation Balance at January 1, $2,948 $3,085 $248 $269 $59 $65 Service cost 33 41 11 10 3 3 Interest cost 66 52 3 3 1 1 Actuarial (gain) loss (a)(818)(126)(38)(8)(7)(3)Plan settlements(266)(10)— (24)— — Benefit payments(90)(90)(12)(2)(4)(7)Plan amendments— 2 — — — — Foreign currency exchange rate changes (71)(6)— — — — Balance at December 31, (b)$1,802 $2,948 $212 $248 $52 $59 Change in Fair Value of Plan AssetsBalance at January 1,$3,357 $3,043 $— $— $— $— Actual return on plan assets(469)417 — — — — Employer contributions1 6 12 26 4 7 Plan settlements(266)(10)— (24)— — Benefit payments(90)(90)(12)(2)(4)(7)Foreign currency exchange rate changes(83)(9)— — — — Balance at December 31,$2,450 $3,357 $— $— $— $— Funded Status (Plan assets greater (less) than benefit obligations) at December 31,$648 $409 $(212)$(248)$(52)$(59)Unrecognized Net Actuarial (Gains) Losses$337 $501 $23 $66 $(27)$(21)(a)Changes in discount rates resulted in actuarial gains of $874 million in 2022 (2021: $178 million of actuarial gains). Changes in mortality assumptions resulted in actuarial losses of $8 million in 2022 (2021: $7 million of actuarial losses). Changes in all other assumptions, including inflation and demographic assumptions, resulted in actuarial losses of $3 million in 2022 (2021: $34 million of actuarial losses of which $36 million of actuarial losses related to changes in the inflation assumptions for our U.K. pension plan).(b)At December 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligation for the funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans was $1,743 million and $180 million, respectively (2021: $2,856 million and $208 million, respectively).69 Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31 consisted of the following:FundedPension PlansUnfundedPension PlanPostretirementMedical Plan 202220212022202120222021 (In millions)Noncurrent assets$648 $409 $— $— $— $— Current liabilities— — (24)(34)(6)(6)Noncurrent liabilities— — (188)(214)(46)(53)Pension assets / (accrued benefit liability)$648 $409 $(212)$(248)$(52)$(59)Accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss, pre-tax (a)$337 $501 $23 $66 $(27)$(21)(a)The after‑tax deficit reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was $131 million at December 31, 2022 (2021: $338 million deficit).The net periodic benefit cost for funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, is as follows: Pension PlansPostretirement Medical Plan 202220212020202220212020 (In millions)Service cost $44 $51 $50 $3 $3 $3 Interest cost 69 55 73 1 1 1 Expected return on plan assets (196)(197)(180)— — — Amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses (gains)11 58 48 (1)(1)(1)Settlement loss 2 9 — — — — Net Periodic Benefit Cost / (Income) (a)$(70)$(24)$(9)$3 $3 $3 (a)Net non-service cost, which is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income, was income of $114 million in 2022 (2021: $75 million of income; 2020: $59 million of income).In 2022, the Hess Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan purchased a single premium annuity contract at a cost of $166 million using assets of the plan to settle and transfer certain of its obligations to a third party. This partial settlement resulted in a noncash settlement loss of $13 million to recognize unamortized actuarial losses. In 2022, the HOVENSA Legacy Employees' Pension Plan paid lump sums of $20 million to certain participants, and purchased a single premium annuity contract at a cost of $80 million, to settle the plan's projected benefit obligation in connection with terminating the plan. The settlement transactions resulted in a noncash settlement gain of $11 million to recognize unamortized actuarial gains. The assets remaining after settlement of the plan's projected benefit obligation of $15 million were transferred to the Hess Corporation Employees' Pension Plan in December 2022.In 2023, we forecast service cost for our pension and postretirement medical plans to be approximately $40 million and net non-service cost of approximately $60 million of income, which is comprised of interest cost of approximately $100 million, and estimated expected return on plan assets of approximately $160 million. Assumptions: The weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 and net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended December 31 for our funded and unfunded pension plans were as follows: 202220212020Benefit Obligations: Discount rate 5.0%2.5%2.2%Rate of compensation increase 4.0%3.8%3.8%Net Periodic Benefit Cost:Discount rateService cost3.3%2.6%3.2%Interest cost3.0%1.7%2.6%Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.5%6.6%6.7%Rate of compensation increase 3.8%3.8%3.8%70The actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 for the postretirement medical plan were as follows: 202220212020Discount rate 4.9%2.4%1.9%Initial health care trend rate 6.3%5.5%6.0%Ultimate trend rate 4.0%4.0%4.5%Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 204620462038The assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for each year were established at the end of each previous year. In 2022 and 2021, there was an interim remeasurement of the funded status of certain plans due to plan settlements which resulted in net periodic benefit cost being recalculated for the remainder of the year using assumptions as of the interim remeasurement dates. The assumptions disclosed in the preceding table used to determine net periodic benefit cost for 2022 and 2021 are a weighted average of the assumptions as of the end of the previous year and the interim remeasurement dates. The assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were established at each year end. The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of benefit obligations are based on actuarial assumptions that are reviewed on an annual basis. Discount rates are developed based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of assets to that asset category. The future expected rate of return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. The expected rate of return on plan assets is applied to the fair value of plan assets to determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost for the year.Our investment strategy is to maximize long‑term returns at an acceptable level of risk through broad diversification of plan assets in a variety of asset classes. Asset classes and target allocations are determined by our investment committee and include domestic and foreign equities, fixed income, and other investments, including hedge funds, real estate and private equity. Investment managers are prohibited from investing in securities issued by us unless indirectly held as part of an index strategy. The majority of plan assets are highly liquid, providing ample liquidity for benefit payment requirements. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we updated our target allocations to 30% equity securities, 50% fixed income securities (including cash and short‑term investment funds) and 20% to all other types of investments. Asset allocations are rebalanced on a periodic basis throughout the year to bring assets to within an acceptable range of target levels.71Fair value: The following tables provide the fair value of the financial assets of the funded pension plans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 in accordance with the fair value measurement hierarchy described in Note 1, Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies.

The inclusion of such amounts in the above table is intended to aid reconciliation of investments categorized in the fair value hierarchy to total pension plan assets. The following describes the financial assets of the funded pension plans:Cash and short‑term investment funds – Consists of cash on hand and short-term investment funds that provide for daily investments and redemptions which are classified as Level 1.Equities – Consists of individually held U.S. and international equity securities. This investment category also includes funds that consist primarily of U.S. and international equity securities. Equity securities, which are individually held and are traded actively on exchanges, are classified as Level 1. Certain funds, consisting primarily of equity securities, are classified as Level 2 if the NAV is determined and published daily, and is the basis for current transactions. Commingled funds, consisting primarily of equity securities, are valued using the NAV per fund share.Fixed income investments – Consists of individually held securities issued by the U.S. government, non-U.S. governments, governmental agencies, municipalities and corporations, and agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities. This investment category also includes funds that consist primarily of fixed income securities. Individual fixed income securities are generally valued on the basis of evaluated prices from independent pricing services. Such prices are monitored by the trustee, which also serves as the independent third-party custodial firm responsible for safekeeping assets of the particular plan, and are classified as Level 2. Exchange-traded funds consisting of fixed income securities are classified as Level 1. Certain funds, consisting primarily of fixed 72income securities, are classified as Level 2 if the NAV is determined and published daily, and is the basis for current transactions. Commingled funds, consisting primarily of fixed income securities, are valued using the NAV per fund share.Other investments – Consists of exchange‑traded real estate investment trust securities, which are classified as Level 1. Commingled funds and limited partnership investments in hedge funds, private equity and real estate funds are valued at the NAV per fund share.Contributions and estimated future benefit payments: In 2023, we expect to contribute approximately $12 million to our funded pension plans.Estimated future benefit payments by the funded and unfunded pension plans, and the postretirement medical plan, which reflect expected future service, are as follows (in millions):2023$108 2024112 2025112 2026159 2027115 Years 2028 to 2032616 We also have defined contribution plans for certain eligible employees. Employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to these plans and we match a portion of the employee contributions. We recorded expense of $22 million in 2022 for contributions to these plans (2021: $18 million; 2020: $22 million).7310.

There was no sales revenue from non-customers in 2021 or 2020.(c)Other operating revenues are not a component of revenues from contracts with customers. Included within other operating revenues are gains (losses) on commodity derivatives of $(585) million in 2022, $(243) million in 2021, and $547 million in 2020.11. Dispositions2022: We completed the sale of our 8% interest in the Waha Concession in Libya for net cash consideration of $150 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $76 million ($76 million after income taxes). We also completed the sale of real property related to our former downstream business for cash consideration of $24 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes).2021: We completed the sale of our interests in Denmark for net cash consideration of approximately $130 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $29 million ($29 million after income taxes). In addition, we completed the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interests in the Bakken for net cash consideration of $297 million, after normal closing adjustments. The sale included approximately 78,700 net acres, which are located in the southernmost portion of the Corporation's Bakken position. The acreage constituted part of a larger amortization base and the sale was treated as a normal retirement. Accordingly, no gain or loss was recognized upon sale.2020: We completed the sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for proceeds of $482 million, after normal closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $79 million ($79 million after income taxes). 7412. Impairment and OtherOil and Gas Properties:In September 2022, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $28 million ($28 million after income taxes) that resulted from updates to our estimated abandonment liabilities for non-producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and $26 million ($26 million after income taxes) to fully impair the net book value of our interests in the Penn State Field in the Gulf of Mexico due to a mechanical issue on the field's remaining production well.In June 2021, we recognized a charge of $147 million ($147 million after income taxes) in connection with estimated abandonment obligations for seven leases in the West Delta Field in the Gulf of Mexico, which we sold to a Fieldwood predecessor in 2004. See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations.As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices due to the global economic slowdown from COVID-19, we reviewed our oil and gas properties within the Exploration and Production operating segment for impairment in the first quarter of 2020. We recognized pre-tax impairment charges in the first quarter of 2020 to reduce the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and certain related ROU assets at the North Malay Basin in Malaysia by $755 million ($755 million after income taxes), the South Arne Field in Denmark by $670 million ($594 million after income taxes), and in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede Field by $410 million ($410 million after income taxes) and the Tubular Bells Field by $270 million ($270 million after income taxes) primarily as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The impairment charges were based on estimates of fair value at March 31, 2020 determined by discounting internally developed future net cash flows, a Level 3 fair value measurement.Other Assets:In the first quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges totaling $21 million pre-tax ($20 million after income taxes) related to drilling rig ROU assets in the Bakken and surplus materials and supplies.13. Share-based CompensationWe have established and maintain LTIP for the granting of restricted common shares, PSUs and stock options to our employees. At December 31, 2022, the total number of authorized common stock under the LTIP was 63.5 million shares, of which we have 21.5 million shares available for issuance. Share‑based compensation expense consisted of the following: 202220212020 (In millions)Restricted stock$52 $49 $51 Performance share units20 18 18 Stock options11 10 10 Share-based compensation expense before income taxes$83 $77 $79 Income tax benefit on share-based compensation expense$— $— $— Based on share‑based compensation awards outstanding at December 31, 2022, unearned compensation expense, before income taxes, of $82 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years.Our share-based compensation plans can be summarized as follows:Restricted stock: Restricted stock generally vests equally on an annual basis over a three-year term and is valued based on the prevailing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.

The number of shares of common stock to be issued under a PSU agreement is based on a comparison of the Corporation’s total shareholder return (TSR) to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies and the S&P 500 index over a three-year performance period ending December 31 of the year prior to settlement of the grant. Payouts of the performance share awards will range from 0% to 200% of the target awards based on the Corporation’s TSR ranking within the peer group. Dividend equivalents for the performance period will accrue on performance shares but will only be paid out on earned shares after the performance period.

The deferred tax asset is comprised of $128 million attributable to foreign net operating losses which will begin to expire in 2025, $3,607 million attributable to U.S. federal operating losses which will begin to expire in 2034, and $491 million attributable to losses in various U.S. states which will begin to expire in 2023. The deferred tax asset attributable to foreign net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, is $23 million. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to U.S. federal and state net operating losses, except for $24 million of U.S. federal and $5 million of U.S. state deferred tax assets attributable to Midstream activities for which separate U.S. federal and state tax returns are filed. At December 31, 2022, we have U.S. state tax credit carryforwards of $24 million, which will begin to expire in 2034, $74 million of other business credit carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2036, and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1 million, which will begin to expire in 2024. A full valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset attributable to these credits. At December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $3,658 million (2021: $3,838 million) valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on application of the relevant accounting standards. Hess continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the U.S. (non-Midstream) and Malaysia, and certain other jurisdictions, and did so against its deferred tax assets in Denmark prior to its sale in 2021 (see Note 11, Dispositions). The reduction in valuation allowance year over year is primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax asset balances in the U.S. (non-Midstream) and Malaysia. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. A recent cumulative loss incurred in the U.S. and Malaysia constitutes significant objective negative evidence. Such objective negative evidence limits our ability to consider subjective positive evidence, such as our projections of future taxable income, resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for these jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight can be given to subjective evidence. There is a reasonable possibility that if anticipated future earnings come to fruition and no other unforeseen negative evidence materializes, sufficient positive evidence may become available to support the release of all or a portion of the Company's valuation allowance in these jurisdictions in the near term. This would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period in which the release is recorded. 78Below is a reconciliation of the gross beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: 202220212020 (In millions)Balance at January 1$133 $166 $168 Additions based on tax positions taken in the current year17 12 2 Additions based on tax positions of prior years— 3 1 Reductions based on tax positions of prior years(30)(48)(2)Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities— — (1)Reductions due to lapses in statutes of limitation— — (2)Balance at December 31$120 $133 $166 There is no balance at December 31, 2022 for unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized would impact our effective income tax rate.

At December 31, 2022, we have no accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits (2021: $6 million).We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to examinations by income tax authorities in most jurisdictions for years prior to 2009.15.

Guarantees, Contingencies and CommitmentsGuarantees and ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. A liability is recognized in our consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those contingencies. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages.We, along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including us. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE was a defective product and that these producers and refiners are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. The majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled. There are two remaining active cases, filed by Pennsylvania and Maryland. In June 2014, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in Pennsylvania, have damaged the groundwater by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The Pennsylvania suit has been forwarded to the existing MTBE multidistrict litigation pending in the Southern District of New York. In December 2017, the State of Maryland filed a lawsuit alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in Maryland by introducing thereto gasoline with MTBE. The suit, filed in Maryland state court, was served on us in January 2018 and has been removed to federal court by the defendants.In September 2003, we received a directive from the NJDEP to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River. The NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned. We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination; this work remains ongoing. We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and agreed with the EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site. Since 802016, the EPA has issued a ROD selecting a dredge and cap remedy for both the lower eight miles and the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River at an estimated cost of approximately $1.82 billion. The ROD does not address the Newark Bay, which may require additional remedial action. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given that the EPA has not selected a final remedy for the Newark Bay, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along the river’s length. Further, there are numerous other parties who we expect will bear the cost of remediation and damages.In March 2014, we received an Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the Remedial Design for the remedy selected by the EPA for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site in Brooklyn, New York. Our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal and connected shipbuilding and repair facility adjacent to the Canal. The remedy selected by the EPA includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the Canal and in-situ stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap. The EPA’s original estimate was that this remedy would cost $506 million; however, the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain. We have complied with the EPA’s March 2014 Administrative Order and contributed funding for the Remedial Design based on an allocation of costs among the parties determined by a third-party expert. In January 2020, we received an additional Administrative Order from the EPA requiring us and several other parties to begin Remedial Action along the uppermost portion of the Canal. We intend to comply with this Administrative Order. The remediation work began in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us, and the costs will continue to be allocated amongst the parties, as they were for the Remedial Design.From time to time, we are involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. We periodically receive notices from the EPA that we are a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable. For any site for which we have received such a notice, the EPA’s claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed, or the EPA’s claims have been settled or a settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. Beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including us, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. These proceedings include claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Beginning in 2013, various parishes in Louisiana filed suit against approximately 100 oil and gas companies, including us, alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, the payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. The ultimate impact of such climate and other aforementioned environmental proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean-up cost estimates.Hess Corporation and its subsidiary HONX, Inc. have been named as defendants in various personal injury claims alleging exposure to asbestos and/or other alleged toxic substances while working at a former refinery (owned and operated by subsidiaries or related entities) located in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. On April 28, 2022, HONX, Inc. initiated a Chapter 11 § 524G process in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, to resolve these asbestos-related claims. In February 2023, Hess, HONX, Inc., the Unsecured Creditors’ Committee, and counsel representing claimants, reached a mediated resolution of the matter, contingent upon final approvals of all parties and confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court. In light of this tentative resolution, we have increased our reserve for this matter. See Note 20, Subsequent Events.We are also involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings from time to time in addition to the matters described above, including claims related to post-production deductions from royalty and working interest payments. We may also be exposed to future decommissioning liabilities for divested assets in the event the current or future owners of facilities previously owned by us are determined to be unable to perform such actions, whether due to bankruptcy or otherwise. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding.Subject to the foregoing, in management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including the matters disclosed above, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements, or revise our opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. 81Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments The following table shows aggregate information for certain unconditional purchase obligations and commitments at December 31, 2022, which are not included elsewhere within these Consolidated Financial Statements: Payments Due by PeriodTotal20232024202520262027Thereafter (In millions)Capital expenditures$5,468 $1,492 $1,305 $1,197 $1,065 $79 $330 Operating expenses699 93 90 102 51 50 313 Transportation and related contracts2,176 343 268 221 225 228 891 18. Segment InformationWe currently have two operating segments, E&P and Midstream. The E&P operating segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases and sells crude oil, NGL and natural gas. Production operations over the three years ended December 31, 2022 were in Guyana, the U.S., Malaysia and the JDA, Libya (sold in November 2022) and Denmark (sold in August 2021). The Midstream operating segment provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota. All unallocated costs are reflected under Corporate, Interest and Other. 82The following table presents operating segment financial data (in millions): Exploration and ProductionMidstreamCorporate, Interest and OtherEliminationsTotal2022 Sales and Other Operating Revenues – Third parties$11,324 $— $— $— $11,324 Intersegment Revenues— 1,273 — (1,273)— Sales and Other Operating Revenues$11,324 $1,273 $— $(1,273)$11,324 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$2,396 $269 $(569)$— $2,096 Interest Expense— 150 343 — 493 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization1,520 181 2 — 1,703 Impairment and Other54 — — — 54 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes1,072 27 — — 1,099 Investment in Affiliates88 94 1 — 183 Identifiable Assets15,022 3,775 2,898 — 21,695 Capital Expenditures2,589 232 — — 2,821 2021Sales and Other Operating Revenues – Third parties$7,473 $— $— $— $7,473 Intersegment Revenues— 1,204 — (1,204)— Sales and Other Operating Revenues$7,473 $1,204 $— $(1,204)$7,473 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$770 $286 $(497)$— $559 Interest Expense— 105 376 — 481 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization1,361 166 1 — 1,528 Impairment and Other147 — — — 147 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes585 15 — — 600 Investment in Affiliates94 102 1 — 197 Identifiable Assets14,173 3,671 2,671 — 20,515 Capital Expenditures1,698 183 — — 1,881 2020Sales and Other Operating Revenues – Third parties$4,667 $— $— $— $4,667 Intersegment Revenues— 1,092 — (1,092)— Sales and Other Operating Revenues$4,667 $1,092 $— $(1,092)$4,667 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Hess Corporation$(2,841)$230 $(482)$— $(3,093)Interest Expense— 95 373 — 468 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization1,915 157 2 — 2,074 Impairment and Other2,126 — — — 2,126 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes(12)7 (6)— (11)Capital Expenditures1,678 253 — — 1,931 Corporate, Interest and Other had interest income of $32 million in 2022 (2021: $1 million, 2020: $5 million) which is included in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 83The following table presents financial information by major geographic area: United StatesGuyanaMalaysia and JDAOther (a)Corporate, Interest and otherTotal (In millions)2022 Sales and Other Operating Revenues$7,214 $2,636 $873 $601 $— $11,324 Property, Plant and Equipment (Net) (b)9,937 4,042 1,065 46 8 15,098 2021Sales and Other Operating Revenues$5,378 $754 $738 $603 $— $7,473 Property, Plant and Equipment (Net) (b)9,721 3,064 1,035 352 10 14,182 2020Sales and Other Operating Revenues$3,604 $350 $511 $202 $— $4,667 (a)Other includes our interests in Libya (sold in November 2022), Denmark (sold in August 2021), Suriname and Canada.(b)Property, plant and equipment in the United States in 2022 includes $6,764 million (2021: $6,596 million) attributable to the E&P segment and $3,173 million (2021: $3,125 million) attributable to the Midstream segment.19. Financial Risk Management ActivitiesIn the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, corporate financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities. We maintain a control environment for all of our financial risk management activities under the direction of our Chief Risk Officer. Our Treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes, where applicable. Hedging strategies are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Corporate Financial Risk Management Activities: Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas we produce or reduce our exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to fix the forward selling price, or establish a floor price or a range banded with a floor and ceiling price, for a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts or swaps may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we conduct business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. At December 31, 2022, these forward contracts relate to the British Pound and Malaysian Ringgit. Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt from fixed to floating rates.The notional amounts of outstanding financial risk management derivative contracts were as follows: December 31, 2022December 31, 2021 (In millions)Commodity – crude oil hedge contracts (millions of barrels)— 54.8 Foreign exchange forwards and swaps$177 $145 Interest rate swaps$100 $100 84The table below reflects the gross and net fair values of risk management derivative instruments: AssetsLiabilities (In millions)December 31, 2022 Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments: Interest rate swaps$— $(4)Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments— (4)Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Foreign exchange forwards and swaps— (2)Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments— (2)Gross fair value of derivative contracts— (6)Gross amount offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet— — Net Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet$— $(6)December 31, 2021Derivative Contracts Designated as Hedging Instruments:Crude oil collars$155 $— Interest rate swaps2 — Total derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments157 — Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:Foreign exchange forwards and swaps— (1)Total derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments— (1)Gross fair value of derivative contracts157 (1)Gross amount offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet— — Net Amounts Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet$157 $(1)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of our interest rate swaps is presented within Other liabilities and deferred credits and non-current Other assets, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of our foreign exchange forwards and swaps is presented within Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of our crude oil hedge contracts is presented within Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. All fair values in the table above are based on Level 2 inputs.Crude oil price hedging contracts decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $585 million in 2022 (2021: decrease of $243 million; 2020: increase of $547 million). The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a decrease of $6 million in 2022 (2021: $3 million decrease; 2020: $4 million increase) with a corresponding adjustment in the carrying value of the hedged fixed‑rate debt. We recognized net foreign exchange losses of $16 million in 2022 (2021: $3 million; 2020: $8 million). Offsetting these net foreign exchange losses were net gains from our foreign exchange derivative contracts, that are not designated as hedges, of $14 million in 2022 (2021: $1 million; 2020: $2 million). Foreign exchange gains and losses, and the gains and losses on our foreign exchange derivative contracts, are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.Credit Risk: We are exposed to credit risks that may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties, groups of counterparties or customers. Accounts receivable are generated from a diverse domestic and international customer base. At December 31, 2022, our accounts receivable were concentrated with the following counterparty industry segments: Integrated companies 49%, Independent E&P companies 31%, Refining and marketing companies 10%, Storage and transportation companies 4%, National oil companies 2%, and Others 4%. We reduce risk related to certain counterparties, where applicable, by using master netting arrangements and requiring collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $83 million (2021: $259 million). Fair Value Measurement: At December 31, 2022, our total long-term debt, which was substantially comprised of fixed rate debt instruments, had a carrying value of $8,281 million and a fair value of $8,192 million, based on Level 2 inputs in the fair value measurement hierarchy. We also have short-term financial instruments, primarily cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, for which the carrying value approximated fair value at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.20. Subsequent EventsIn February 2023, we reached a mediated resolution of a legal matter associated with our former downstream business, HONX, Inc., contingent upon final approvals of all parties and confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court. Fourth quarter 2022 results include a charge of $101 million to increase our reserve based on this tentative resolution, which is included in General and administrative expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. See Note 17, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments. 85In February 2023, the operator completed the Fish/Tarpon-1 exploration well at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. The well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and 2022 financial results include $34 million of exploration expense for well costs incurred through December 31, 2022. We estimate approximately $10 million of exploration expense will be recognized in the first quarter of 2023 for well costs incurred after December 31, 2022.Through February 24, 2023, we have hedged 80,000 bopd with WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $70 per barrel, and 10,000 bopd with Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $75 per barrel for the remainder of 2023. 86HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIESSUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DATA (UNAUDITED)The Supplementary Oil and Gas Data that follows is presented in accordance with ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities, and includes (1) costs incurred, capitalized costs and results of operations relating to oil and gas producing activities, (2) net proved oil and gas reserves and (3) a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves, including a reconciliation of changes therein.

Proved oil and gas reserves are quantities, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by our internal teams of geoscience and reservoir engineering professionals. Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of June 25, 2019).” The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir, the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate, the stage of reservoir development and the production history. Subsurface data used included well logs, reservoir core and fluid samples, production and pressure testing, static and dynamic pressure information, and reservoir surveillance. Where applicable, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation, as defined in the SEC regulations. These technologies, including computational methods, must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In some cases, where appropriate, use of empirical and analytical methods, combined with analog data were used. Analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies were used to increase the quality and confidence in the reserves estimates.In order for reserves to be classified as proved, any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project, either senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the development. Our proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10‑K.Internal ControlsThe Corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation processes, which are administered by our Global Reserves group and our Chief Financial Officer. Estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff who work directly with the oil and gas properties using industry standard reserve estimation principles, definitions and methodologies. Each year, reserve estimates of the Corporation’s assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews. In addition, an independent third-party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the Corporation’s reported reserves (see pages 89 through 94). Reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors.QualificationsThe person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Corporation’s oil and gas reserves during 2022 was the Senior Manager, Global Reserves. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a MSc degree in Petroleum Engineering. His experience has been primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas. He is also responsible for the Corporation’s Global Reserves group, which is the internal organization that establishes the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews.Reserves AuditWe engaged the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating approximately 89% of 2022 year‑end reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (2021: 88%). The purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with SEC regulations. The D&M report, dated February 1, 2023, on the Corporation’s estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry. D&M is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years. D&M’s letter report on the Corporation’s December 31, 2022 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this Form 10‑K. While the D&M report should be read in its entirety, the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by D&M, the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by Hess and independently evaluated by D&M, in the aggregate, differed by approximately 2.6% (2021: less than 2.5%) of total audited net proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The report also includes among other information, the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the reserve audit.Crude Oil Prices Used to Estimate Proved ReservesProved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period before December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2022 were $94.13 per barrel for WTI (2021: $66.34; 2020: $39.77) and $97.98 per barrel for Brent (2021: 89$68.92; 2020: $43.43). New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices used were $6.44 per mcf in 2022 (2021: $3.68; 2020: $2.16).At December 31, 2022, spot prices closed at $80.26 per barrel for WTI and $81.33 per barrel for Brent. If crude oil prices in 2023 are at levels below that used in determining 2022 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2023 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2023 above those used in determining 2022 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2023. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2023, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2023 crude oil prices, the amount of any additions to proved reserves, positive or negative revisions in proved reserves related to 2023 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will change in response to 2023 crude oil prices, and management’s plans as of December 31, 2023 for developing proved undeveloped reserves.

Additions to proved developed reserves primarily resulted from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota and the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 183 million boe (146 million barrels of crude oil, 19 million barrels of NGL and 108 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 93.2021: Total Additions were 295 million boe, of which 25 million boe (14 million barrels of crude oil, 7 million barrels of NGL and 24 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves primarily resulted from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 270 million boe (157 million barrels of crude oil, 66 million barrels of NGL and 285 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 93.2020: Total Additions were 142 million boe, of which 12 million boe (8 million barrels of crude oil, 2 million barrels of NGL and 14 million mcf of natural gas) related to proved developed reserves. Additions to proved developed reserves primarily resulted from drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota. Additions to proved undeveloped reserves were 130 million boe (98 million barrels of crude oil, 16 million barrels of NGL and 93 million mcf of natural gas) and are discussed in further detail on page 93. 91Revisions of previous estimates2022: Total revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves amounted to a net decrease of 13 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to a net increase of 20 million boe (20 million barrels of NGL and 82 million mcf of natural gas offset by a decrease of 14 million barrels of crude oil). In the United States, net positive revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken were 17 million boe relating to the capture of additional gas volumes (50%), well performance largely driven by an increase in gas volume estimates partially offset by an oil volume reduction (30%), and the impact of higher commodity prices (20%). In Guyana, net positive revisions to proved developed reserves totaled 2 million boe due to increased recovery based on performance and other positive revisions (7 million boe), partially offset by the impact of higher commodity prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract (5 million boe). Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 93.2021: Total revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves amounted to a net increase of 53 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to an increase of 73 million boe (31 million barrels of crude oil, 27 million barrels of NGL and 88 million mcf of natural gas). In the United States, net positive revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken of 68 million boe were due to higher commodity prices (39 million boe) and improved well performance (32 million boe), partially offset by other negative revisions of 3 million boe. In the Gulf of Mexico, positive revisions to proved developed reserves were 10 million boe, including 5 million boe of positive price revisions and 5 million boe of other revisions, primarily improved well performance. In Malaysia and JDA, net negative revisions to proved developed reserves were 6 million boe due to the impact of higher commodity prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract at JDA (50%) and performance at North Malay Basin and JDA (50%). Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 93.2020: Total revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves amounted to a net decrease of 25 million boe, of which revisions of proved developed reserves amounted to an increase of 108 million boe (38 million barrels of crude oil, 30 million barrels of NGL and 237 million mcf of natural gas). In the United States, revisions to proved developed reserves from the Bakken were a net increase of 55 million boe, comprised of positive revisions of 77 million boe and negative price revisions of 22 million boe. The positive revisions resulted from well performance (50%), updated yield and decline factors (30%) and other changes (20%), primarily driven by cost reductions. In the Gulf of Mexico, net negative revisions were 8 million boe, including 2 million boe of negative price revisions. In Guyana, revisions increased proved developed reserves by 47 million boe related to performance (55%), improved recovery associated with water injection (35%), and increased natural gas for consumption (10%). In Malaysia and JDA, net revisions to proved developed reserves were an increase of 18 million boe due to performance at North Malay Basin and JDA (80%) and the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract at JDA (20%). Other had negative revisions to proved developed reserves of 4 million boe, primarily in Libya. Revisions associated with proved undeveloped reserves are discussed in further detail on page 93.Sales of minerals in place (‘Asset sales’)2022: Asset sales relate to the divestiture of our working interest in the Waha Concession in Libya.2021: Asset sales relate to the divestiture of our working interests in Denmark and our acreage interests in the Little Knife and Murphy Creek area of the Bakken.2020: Asset sales relate to the divestiture of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 92Proved Undeveloped ReservesFollowing are the Corporation’s proved undeveloped reserves: UnitedStatesGuyanaMalaysia and JDAOther (a)Total (Millions of boe)Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves At January 1, 2020344563325458Revisions of previous estimates(146)42(4)(25)(133)Extensions, discoveries and other additions78502—130Transfers to proved developed reserves(85)(8)(7)—(100)Sales of minerals in place(3)———(3)At December 31, 202018814024—352Revisions of previous estimates(16)(4)——(20)Extensions, discoveries and other additions25794—270Transfers to proved developed reserves(19)—(4)—(23)Sales of minerals in place(39)———(39)At December 31, 202137114524—540Revisions of previous estimates(35)5(3)—(33)Extensions, discoveries and other additions81102——183Transfers to proved developed reserves(63)(79)(9)—(151)At December 31, 202235417312—539(a)Other includes our interests in Libya (sold in November 2022) and Denmark (sold in August 2021).Extensions, discoveries and other additions (‘Additions’)2022: In the United States, Additions in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota from new wells planned to be drilled in the next five years were 79 million boe. In Guyana, Additions of 102 million boe were due to the sanctioning of the Yellowtail Field development (94 million boe), and extension of the proved area of the Payara Field (8 million boe). 2021: In the United States, Additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 257 million boe, which resulted from additional undeveloped well locations due to improved economic conditions, planned additional drilling activity, and development plan optimization. In Guyana, Additions of 9 million boe related to the deepening of the hydrocarbon contact for Liza Phase 2. In Malaysia and JDA, Additions were due to additional planned wells to be drilled.2020: In the United States, Additions from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota were 78 million boe, which primarily resulted from new wells planned to be drilled in the next five years, including the impact of optimizing locations in the development plan. In Guyana, Additions of 50 million boe were due to the sanction of the Payara project. In Malaysia, Additions at the North Malay Basin were due to additional planned wells to be drilled.Revisions of previous estimates2022: In the United States, net negative reserve revisions of 35 million boe were primarily from the Bakken, which included a net decrease of 26 million boe related to wells moved outside the five-year development plan, and other negative revisions of 9 million boe primarily related to performance and updates to ownership interests. In Guyana, net positive reserve revisions were 5 million boe, which included a net increase of 13 million boe primarily from increased recovery based on performance partially offset by negative revisions of 8 million boe related to the impact of higher crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract.2021: In the United States, net negative reserve revisions of 16 million boe were primarily from the Bakken, which included a decrease of 88 million boe largely related to wells moved outside the five-year development plan mainly based on optimization of drilling locations and other net negative revisions of 8 million boe, partially offset by positive revisions of 80 million boe related to higher prices. In Guyana, net negative reserve revisions were 4 million boe, which included negative revisions of 16 million boe related to the impact of higher crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract and negative revisions of 3 million boe resulting from decreased natural gas for consumption. Positive revisions of 15 million boe in Guyana resulted from improved recovery associated with water and gas injection.2020: In the United States, negative reserve revisions of 146 million boe were from the Bakken, which included negative price revisions of 77 million boe, and a decrease of 121 million boe from wells moved outside our management and Board approved five-year plan due to a reduction in planned rig count and optimization of drilling locations in response to the decline in crude oil prices in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by positive revisions of 52 million boe, primarily due to optimized development spacing and increased well productivity. In Guyana, net positive reserve revisions for Liza Phase 1 and Phase 2 93totaling 42 million boe resulted from improved recovery associated with water injection (45%), the impact of lower crude oil prices on entitlement allocations in the production sharing contract (40%) and increased natural gas for consumption (15%). For Other, net negative reserves revisions were 14 million boe in Libya and 11 million boe in Denmark due to moving planned wells outside our five-year plan in response to the decline in crude oil prices in 2020.Transfers to proved developed reserves (‘Transfers’)2022: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves totaled 79 million boe in Guyana primarily related to the startup of production from the Liza Phase 2 development in February 2022. In the United States, Transfers were 59 million boe in the Bakken and 4 million boe in the Gulf of Mexico resulting from drilling activity. Transfers in the United States for 2022 were consistent with the development plan used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2021. In the Bakken, we added a fourth rig in July 2022, and we plan to operate four rigs going forward. In Malaysia and JDA, Transfers of 9 million boe resulted from drilling activity. 2021: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves resulting from drilling activity included 19 million boe in the Bakken, and 4 million boe at JDA. Transfers in 2021 were consistent with the development plan used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2020.2020: Transfers from proved undeveloped reserves resulting from drilling activity included 83 million boe in the Bakken, 2 million boe in the Gulf of Mexico, 8 million boe for Liza Phase 1 in Guyana, and 7 million boe in the North Malay Basin.In 2022, capital expenditures of $1,780 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (2021: $190 million; 2020: $1,090 million).At December 31, 2022, projects that have proved reserves that have been classified as undeveloped for a period in excess of five years totaled 14 million boe, or approximately 1% of total proved reserves, related to the multi-phase offshore developments, primarily at the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, and North Malay Basin, offshore Malaysia.Production Sharing ContractsThe Corporation’s proved reserves include crude oil and natural gas reserves relating to long‑term agreements with governments or authorities in which the Corporation has the legal right to produce or has a revenue interest in the production. The Corporation's operations with these production sharing arrangements include those in Guyana, Malaysia, and the JDA. Proved reserves for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, as well as volumes produced and received during 2022, 2021 and 2020 from these production sharing contracts are presented in the proved reserve tables on pages 90 and 91. Revisions resulting from the entitlement impact of price changes in production sharing contracts decreased proved reserves by 14 million boe in 2022 (2021: 17 million boe decrease; 2020: 22 million boe increase). 94Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas ReservesFuture net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining year‑end reserve estimates (adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development costs (including future abandonment expenditures) and future production costs, which are based on year‑end costs and existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year‑end statutory tax rates to the pre‑tax net cash flows, as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%.The prices used for the discounted future net cash flows in 2022 were $94.13 per barrel for WTI (2021: $66.34; 2020: $39.77) and $97.98 per barrel for Brent (2021: $68.92; 2020: $43.43) and do not include the effects of commodity hedges. NYMEX natural gas prices used were $6.44 per mcf in 2022 (2021: $3.68; 2020: $2.16). Selling prices have in the past, and can in the future, fluctuate significantly. As a result, selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices. The discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses, interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses. The amount of tax deductions, credits, and allowances relating to the Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves, variances in actual pre-tax cash flows from forecasted pre-tax cash flows in historical periods, and the impact to year-end carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the Corporation’s income tax returns exploration expenses, interest expense, and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not contemplated in the standardized measure computations. The future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used.At December 31TotalUnitedStatesGuyanaMalaysia and JDAOther (a) (In millions)2022 Future revenues$80,822 $50,373 $28,060 $2,389 $— Less:Future production costs19,640 14,141 4,687 812 — Future development costs11,088 5,186 5,430 472 — Future income tax expenses11,795 7,308 4,307 180 — 42,523 26,635 14,424 1,464 — Future net cash flows38,299 23,738 13,636 925 — Less: Discount at 10% annual rate17,382 12,677 4,589 116 — Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$20,917 $11,061 $9,047 $809 $— 2021Future revenues$55,788 $32,054 $13,940 $2,759 $7,035 Less:Future production costs15,553 11,246 3,043 910 354 Future development costs8,122 4,342 3,063 543 174 Future income tax expenses11,257 3,625 1,516 151 5,965 34,932 19,213 7,622 1,604 6,493 Future net cash flows20,856 12,841 6,318 1,155 542 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate9,603 7,073 2,091 193 246 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$11,253 $5,768 $4,227 $962 $296 2020Future revenues$28,745 $11,757 $8,362 $2,578 $6,048 Less:Future production costs12,360 6,887 2,784 1,073 1,616 Future development costs6,322 2,593 2,617 677 435 Future income tax expenses4,135 45 380 110 3,600 22,817 9,525 5,781 1,860 5,651 Future net cash flows5,928 2,232 2,581 718 397 Less: Discount at 10% annual rate2,343 1,205 935 123 80 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows$3,585 $1,027 $1,646 $595 $317 (a)Other includes our interests in Libya (sold in November 2022) and Denmark (sold in August 2021). 95Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas ReservesFor the Years Ended December 31202220212020 (In millions)Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at January 1$11,253 $3,585 $8,385 Changes during the year:Sales and transfers of oil and gas produced during the year, net of production costs(5,342)(3,282)(1,829)Development costs incurred during the year2,231 1,437 1,479 Net changes in prices and production costs11,649 11,321 (10,141)Net change in estimated future development costs(2,156)(1,695)1,860 Extensions and discoveries (including improved recovery) of oil and gas reserves, less related costs5,655 2,419 543 Revisions of previous oil and gas reserve estimates(188)461 364 Net purchases (sales) of minerals in place, before income taxes(3,099)(196)(500)Accretion of discount1,338 578 1,220 Net change in income taxes(450)(3,477)2,091 Revision in rate or timing of future production and other changes26 102 113 Total9,664 7,668 (4,800)Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows at December 31$20,917 $11,253 $3,585 96Item 9.
