895728,ENB,ENBRIDGE INC,2018,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.Our funding plan is designed to sustain strong investment grade credit ratings, which are key to cost-effectively funding future growth. We have already begun taking actions to accelerate planned deleveraging and balance sheet strengthening, including the issuance of approximately $2 billion of new common equity and $500 million in preferred equity financing in late 2017. Over the remainder of the current planning horizon (2018-2020) we plan to continue to strengthen the balance sheet while building out the balance of our secured growth program. We plan to accomplish this through issuing additional hybrid securities, issuance of common equity through our Dividend Reinvestment Program and the sale or monetization of non-core assets. Consistent with our risk management policy, we have implemented a comprehensive long-term economic hedging program to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity price on our earnings and cash flow. This economic hedging program together with ongoing management of credit exposures to customers, suppliers and counterparties helps reinforce our reliable business model, which is one of the key tenets of our investor value proposition. For further details, refer to Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.We continually assess ways to generate value for shareholders, including reviewing opportunities that may lead to acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions, some of which may be material. Opportunities are screened, analyzed and assessed using strict operating, strategic and financial criteria with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital and enduring financial strength and stability.Secure the Longer-Term FutureA key strategic priority is the development and enhancement of strategic growth platforms from which to secure our long-term future. We expect to benefit from a diversified set of strategic growth platforms, including liquids and gas pipelines, an attractive portfolio of regulated natural gas distribution utilities and a growing offshore renewable power generation business. The strength of the combined assets and geographic footprint will generate highly transparent and predictable cash flows underpinned by high quality commercial constructs that align closely with our investor value proposition and significant ongoing organic growth potential.MAINTAIN THE FOUNDATIONUphold Enbridge ValuesWe adhere to a strong set of core values that govern how we conduct our business and pursue strategic priorities, as articulated in our value statement: “Enbridge employees demonstrate integrity, safety and respect in support of our communities, the environment and each other”. Employees are expected to uphold these values in their interactions with each other, customers, suppliers, landowners, community members and all others with whom we deal and ensure our business decisions are consistent with these values. Employees and contractors are required, on an annual basis, to certify their compliance with our Statement on Business Conduct.9Maintain Our License to OperateEarning and sustaining the trust of our stakeholders is critical to our ability to execute on our growth plans and ensure that our business strategy, as well as our corporate policies and management systems, are continuously informed by the social and environmental context surrounding our projects and operations. A key priority is to establish and maintain constructive relationships with local stakeholders over the life-cycle of our assets. The linear nature of our energy infrastructure puts us in contact with a large number of diverse communities, landowners and regulatory bodies across North America. Because Indigenous communities have distinct rights, we have dedicated resources focused on Indigenous consultation and inclusion. Early identification of local concerns enables us to respond quickly and take a proactive approach to problem solving. Early engagement also enables us to provide expanded opportunities for socio-economic participation through employment, training, and procurement, as well as through the development of joint initiatives on safety, environmental and cultural protection. More broadly, our goal is to build awareness and balanced dialogue on the role and value of the energy we deliver to our society and economy. We communicate with different stakeholders, decision makers, customers and other interested groups - including investors, employees and the public - about the access we provide to safe, reliable, affordable energy. We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives in our annual CSR Report which can be found at http://csr.enbridge.com. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Attract, Retain and Develop Highly Capable PeopleInvesting in the attraction, retention and development of employees and future leaders is fundamental to executing our growth strategy and creating sustainability for future success. We focus on enhancing the capability of our people to maximize the potential of our organization and undertake various activities such as offering accelerated leadership development programs, enhancing career opportunities and building change management capabilities throughout the enterprise so that projects and initiatives achieve intended benefits. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives to our employees.BUSINESS SEGMENTS Our activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution; Green Power and Transmission; and Energy Services, as discussed below.10LIQUIDS PIPELINESLiquids Pipelines consists of common carrier and contract pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and refined products and terminals in Canada and the United States, including the Canadian Mainline, Lakehead Pipeline System (Lakehead System), Regional Oil Sands System, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent, Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and other feeder pipelines.11MAINLINE SYSTEMThe mainline system is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/United States border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the United States/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines, with a combined operating capacity of approximately 2.85 million barrels per day (bpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/United States border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. It also includes certain related pipelines and infrastructure, including decommissioned and deactivated pipelines. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. Effective September 1, 2015, the closing date of the Canadian Restructuring Plan (as defined below), we transferred the Canadian Mainline to the Fund Group (comprising Enbridge Income Fund (the Fund), Enbridge Commercial Trust, Enbridge Income Partners LP (EIPLP) and the subsidiariesof EIPLP) - refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Canadian Restructuring Plan. The Lakehead System is the portion of the mainline system in the United States that continues to be managed by us through our subsidiaries, Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (EEP) and Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from Western Canada to the United States. Competitive Toll SettlementThe Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) is the current framework governing tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. The 10-year settlement was negotiated by representatives of Enbridge, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and shippers on the Canadian Mainline. It was approved by the National Energy Board (NEB) on June 24, 2011 and took effect on July 1, 2011. The CTS provides for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, which is based on the 2011 Incentive Tolling Settlement toll, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada on the Canadian Mainline and delivered into the United States, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. These tolls are denominated in United States dollars. The IJT is designed to provide shippers on the mainline system with a stable and competitive long-term toll, thereby preserving and enhancing throughput on both the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The CLT and the IJT were both established at the time of implementation of the CTS and are adjusted annually, on July 1 of each year, at a rate equal to 75% of the Canada Gross Domestic Product at Market Price Index published by Statistics Canada. Two years prior to the end of the term of the CTS, we and the shippers will establish a group for the purposes of negotiating a new settlement to replace the CTS once it expires. Although the CTS has a 10-year term, it does not require shippers to commit to certain volumes. Shippers nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Canadian Mainline. Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by the CTS and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under the terms of the IJT agreement between us and EEP, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the IJT relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the United States border is equal to the IJT applicable to that batch’s United States delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. This amount is referred to as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll and is denominated in United States dollars. 12Lakehead System Local TollsTransportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/United States border near Neche, North Dakota and from Clearbrook, Minnesota to certain principal delivery points. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are base rates and Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Base rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing base rates, and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1.REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEM The Regional Oil Sands System includes four intra-Alberta long haul pipelines, the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline and the recently completed Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which provide access for oil sands production to the system, and a long-haul intra-Alberta pipeline that transports diluent from the Edmonton, Alberta region into the oil sands producing regions located north and south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System currently serves twelve producing oil sands projects. The Athabasca Pipeline is a 540-kilometer (335-mile) synthetic and heavy oil pipeline. Built in 1999, it links the Athabasca oil sands in the Fort McMurray region to the major Alberta crude oil pipeline hub at Hardisty, Alberta. The Athabasca Pipeline’s capacity is 570,000 bpd, depending on crude slate. We have long-term take-or-pay and non take-or-pay agreements with multiple shippers on the Athabasca Pipeline. Revenues are recorded based on the contract terms negotiated with the major shippers, rather than the cash tolls collected.In 2017, we completed the twinning of the Athabasca Pipeline and the Wood Buffalo Extension, which were key components of our Regional Oil Sands Optimization Project. The Athabasca Pipeline Twin, completed in January 2017, twinned the southern section of the Athabasca Pipeline with a 36-inch diameter pipeline from Kirby Lake, Alberta to the major Alberta pipeline hub at Hardisty, Alberta. The initial capacity of the Athabasca Pipeline Twin is 450,000 bpd and it can be further expanded in the future to 800,000 bpd through additional pumping horsepower. In December 2017, the Wood Buffalo Extension, a 36-inch diameter pipeline between Cheecham, Alberta and Kirby Lake, Alberta, went into service. The integrated Wood Buffalo Extension and Athabasca Pipeline Twin transports diluted bitumen from multiple oil sands producers. The Waupisoo Pipeline is a 380-kilometer (236-mile) synthetic and heavy oil pipeline that entered service in 2008 and provides access to the Edmonton market for oil sands producers. The Waupisoo Pipeline originates at the Cheecham Terminal and terminates at the major Alberta pipeline hub at Edmonton. The pipeline has a capacity of 550,000 bpd, depending on the crude slate. We have long-term take-or-pay agreements with multiple shippers on the Waupisoo Pipeline who have collectively contracted for 80% to 90% of the capacity, subject to the timing of when shippers’ commitments commence and expire. The Woodland Pipeline is a 50/50 joint venture between us and Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Properties that was constructed in two phases. The first phase, completed in 2013, consists of a 140-kilometer (87-mile) 36-inch diameter pipeline from the Kearl oil sands mine to the Cheecham Terminal, and service on our existing Waupisoo Pipeline from Cheecham to the Edmonton area. The second phase extended the Woodland Pipeline south from our Cheecham Terminal to our Edmonton Terminal. Completed in 2014, the extension involved the construction of a 385-kilometer (239-mile) 36-inch diameter pipeline adding 379,000 bpd of capacity to the Regional Oil Sands System. The Woodland Pipeline is anchored by long-term commitments. 13The Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite) was placed into service in May 2017, offering a new diluent supply alternative to meet the needs of multiple producers in the Athabasca oil sands region. Norlite is a 24-inch-diameter pipeline, originating at Enbridge’s Stonefell Terminal, in Strathcona County near Edmonton, Alberta and terminating at Enbridge’s Fort McMurray South facility, near Fort McMurray, Alberta, with a transfer line to Suncor's East Tank Farm. The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 218,000 bpd of diluent, with the potential to be further expanded to approximately 465,000 bpd of capacity with the addition of pump stations. Under an agreement with Keyera Corp. (Keyera), Norlite has the right to access certain existing capacity on Keyera’s pipelines between Edmonton, Alberta and Stonefell, Alberta and, in exchange, Keyera has elected to participate in the new pipeline infrastructure project as a 30% non-operating owner. Norlite is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of oil sands producers. GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENTGulf Coast includes Seaway and Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South), Spearhead Pipeline, as well as the Mid-Continent System comprised of Cushing Terminal and the recently sold Ozark Pipeline that is managed by us through our subsidiary, EEP.Seaway PipelineIn 2011, we acquired a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast. The flow direction of Seaway Pipeline was reversed in 2012, enabling it to transport crude from the oversupplied hub in Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. Further pump station additions and modifications were completed early 2013, increasing capacity available to shippers from an initial 150,000 bpd to up to approximately 400,000 bpd, depending on the crude slate. In late 2014, a second line, the Seaway Pipeline Twin, was placed into service to more than double the existing capacity to 850,000 bpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes a 161-kilometer (100-mile) pipeline from the Enterprise Crude Houston crude oil terminal in Houston, Texas to the Port Arthur/Beaumont, Texas refining center. Flanagan South PipelineFlanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South and associated pumping stations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Flanagan South has an initial design capacity of approximately 600,000 bpd.Spearhead PipelineSpearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline was originally placed into service in 2006 and has an initial capacity of 193,300 bpd.Mid-Continent System The Mid-Continent System is comprised of the storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma and the recently sold Ozark Pipeline. The storage terminals consist of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78,000 to 570,000 barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder is contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, and blending fees. 14In December 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the Ozark Pipeline to a subsidiary of MPLX LP for cash proceeds of approximately $294 million (US$220 million), including $13 million (US$10 million) in reimbursable costs for additional capital spent by us up to the closing date of the transaction. Sale of the Ozark Pipeline system closed on March 1, 2017.SOUTHERN LIGHTS PIPELINESouthern Lights Pipeline is a fully-contracted single stream pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. This 180,000 bpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline was placed into service in 2010. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights Canada) and the United States portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights US) receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Tariffs provide for recovery of all operating and debt financing costs plus a return on equity (ROE) of 10%. Southern Lights Pipeline has assigned 10% of the capacity (18,000 bpd) for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes. As part of the Canadian Restructuring Plan, effective September 1, 2015, we transferred all Class B units of Southern Lights Canada to the Fund Group. Following the closing of the Transaction, the Fund Group holds all the ownership, economic interests and voting rights, direct and indirect, in Southern Lights Canada. We continue to indirectly own all of the Class B Units of Southern Lights US.EXPRESS-PLATTE SYSTEMThe Express-Platte system is comprised of both the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) crude oil transportation system, which begins in Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates in Wood River, Illinois. The Express pipeline carries crude oil to United States refining markets in the Rockies area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline in Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the Midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.BAKKEN SYSTEMOur Bakken assets consist of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System is a joint operation that includes a Canadian entity and a United States entity. The United States portion of the North Dakota System is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system servicing the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks formation. The gathering pipelines collect crude oil from nearly 80 different receipt facilities located throughout western North Dakota and eastern Montana, with delivery to Clearbrook for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The United States interstate portion of the system extends from Berthold, North Dakota to the International Boundary near North Portal, North Dakota, and connects to the Canadian entity at the border to bring the crude oil into Cromer, Manitoba.Tariffs on the United States portion of the North Dakota System are governed by FERC and include a local tariff. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such its tolls are regulated by the NEB on a complaint basis. Tolls are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers. In February 2017, we closed a transaction to acquire a 49% equity interest in the holding company that owns 75% of the Bakken Pipeline System from an affiliate of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. and Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. The Bakken Pipeline System connects the prolific Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the United States Gulf Coast, providing customers with access to premium markets at a competitive cost. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the Dakota Access 15Pipeline and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline projects. The Dakota Access Pipeline consists of 1,886-kilometers (1,172-miles) of 30-inch pipe from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois. Initial capacity is in excess of 470,000 bpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded to 570,000 bpd. The Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline consists of 100-kilometers (62-miles) of new 30-inch diameter pipe, 1,104-kilometers (686-miles) of converted 30-inch diameter pipe, and 64-kilometers (40-miles) of converted 24-inch diameter pipe from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.FEEDER PIPELINES AND OTHERFeeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the United States. Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates out of Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. On July 1, 2014, Marathon executed an agreement with Enbridge to become an owner (35%) in SAX forming the Illinois Extension Pipeline Company (IEPC). Enbridge has 65% ownership in IEPC. SAX was placed into service December 2015 with the majority of its capacity commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the NW System. Patoka Storage is comprised of 4 storage tanks with 480,000 barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The majority of Toledo pipeline’s capacity is commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. The NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta. NW System has a cost of service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.Feeder Pipelines and Other includes contributions from assets which were divested during 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, including investments in Olympic Pipeline Company (Olympic), Eddystone Rail and the South Prairie Region assets.On October 19, 2017, we sold all assets related to our Eddystone rail facility to our partner Canopy in exchange for their 25% share of the joint venture valued at $5 million. These assets primarily included the unit-train unloading facility and related local pipeline infrastructure near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that delivered Bakken and other light sweet crude oil to Philadelphia area refineries.On July 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our 85% interest in Olympic, the largest refined products pipeline in the State of Washington, to an unrelated party for $0.2 billion.On December 1, 2016, EIPLP completed the sale of the South Prairie Region assets to an unrelated party for cash proceeds of $1.08 billion. The South Prairie Region assets transport crude oil and NGL from producing fields and facilities in southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba to Cromer, Manitoba where products enter the mainline system to be transported to the United States or eastern Canada.COMPETITIONCompetition may result in a reduction in demand for our services, fewer project opportunities or assumption of risk that results in weaker or more volatile financial performance than expected. Competition among existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets. Other competing carriers available to ship western Canadian liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the United States and internationally represent competition to our liquids pipelines network. Competition 16also arises from proposed pipelines that seek to access markets currently served by our liquids pipelines, such as proposed projects to the Gulf Coast and from proposed projects enhancing infrastructure in the Alberta regional oil sands market. The Mid-Continent and Bakken systems also face competition from existing competing pipelines, proposed future pipelines and existing and alternative gathering facilities. Competition for storage facilities in the United States includes large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or other competitor pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently serviced by pipelines. We believe that our liquids pipelines continue to provide attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) and North Dakota due to our competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system combined with our commitment to project execution is expected to further provide shippers reliable and long-term competitive solutions for oil transportation. Our existing right-of-way for the mainline system also provides a competitive advantage as it can be difficult and costly to obtain rights of way for new pipelines traversing new areas. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which also mitigate competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the United States, the world’s largest market. While United States’ demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets. The downturn in crude oil prices which began in 2014 has impacted our liquids pipelines’ customers, who responded by reducing their exploration and development spending for 2016 and 2017 in higher cost basins. However, the international market for crude oil has continued to see an increase in production from the North American shale oil producing basins and increased production from specific Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price has been strengthening from US$30 per barrel at the beginning of 2016 as the market has fought to re-balance supply and demand. Prices began to recover in response to cuts in OPEC and non-OPEC production and have continued to recover through 2017. The WTI crude prices averaged US$51 per barrel for 2017 and ended the year above US$60 per barrel. Notwithstanding the current price environment, our mainline system has thus far continued to be highly utilized and in fact, mainline throughput as measured at the Canada/United States border at Gretna, Manitoba saw record throughput of 2.7 million bpd in December 2017. The mainline system continues to be subject to apportionment of heavy crude oil, as nominated volumes currently exceed capacity on portions of the system. The impact of a low crude oil price environment on the financial performance of our liquids pipelines business is expected to be relatively modest given the commercial arrangements which underpin many of the pipelines that make up our liquids system and provide a significant measure of protection against volume fluctuations. In addition, our mainline system is well positioned to continue to provide safe and efficient transportation which will enable western Canadian and Bakken production to reach attractive markets in the United States and eastern Canada at a competitive cost relative to other alternatives. The fundamentals of oil sands production and low crude oil prices have caused some sponsors to reconsider the timing of their upstream oil sands development projects. However, recently updated forecasts continue to reflect long-term supply growth from the WCSB, although the projected pace of growth is slower than previous forecasts as companies continue to assess the viability of certain capital investments in the current price environment and with the ongoing uncertainty related to timing and completion of competing pipeline systems.17Over the long term, global energy consumption is expected to continue to grow, with the growth in crude oil demand primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), mainly India and China. While OECD countries, including Canada, the United States and western European nations, will experience population growth, the emphasis placed on energy efficiency, conservation and a shift to lower carbon fuels, such as natural gas and renewables, is expected to reduce crude oil demand over the long term. Accordingly, there is a strategic opportunity for North American producers to grow production to displace foreign imports and participate in the growing global demand outside North America. In terms of supply, long-term global crude oil production is expected to continue to grow through 2035, with growth in supply primarily contributed by North America, Brazil and OPEC. The expected growth in North America is largely driven by production from the oil sands and the continued development of tight oil plays including the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford formations. Growth in supply from OPEC is primarily a result of a shift in OPEC’s strategy from ‘balancing supply’ to ‘competing for market share’ in Asia and Europe. However, political uncertainty in certain oil producing countries, including Venezuela, Libya, Nigeria and Iraq, increases risk in those regions’ supply growth forecasts and makes North America one of the most secure supply sources of crude oil. As witnessed throughout 2016 and 2017, North American supply growth can be influenced by macro-economic factors that drive down the global crude prices. Over the longer term, North American production from tight oil plays, including the Bakken, is expected to grow as technology continues to improve well productivity and efficiencies. The WCSB, in Canada, is viewed as one of the world’s largest and most secure supply sources of crude oil. However, the pace of growth in North America and level of investment in the WCSB could be tempered in future years by a number of factors including a sustained period of low crude oil prices and corresponding production decisions by OPEC, increasing environmental regulation, and prolonged approval processes for new pipelines with access to tide-water for export. In recent years, the combination of relatively flat domestic demand, growing supply and long-lead time to build pipeline infrastructure led to a fundamental change in the North American crude oil landscape. The inability to move increasing inland supply to tide-water markets resulted in a divergence between WTI and world pricing, resulting in lower netbacks for North American producers than could otherwise be achieved if selling into global markets. The impact of price differentials has been even more pronounced for western Canadian producers as insufficient pipeline infrastructure resulted in a further discounting of Alberta crude against WTI. With a number of market access initiatives completed by the industry in recent years, including those introduced by us, the crude oil price differentials significantly narrowed in 2015, and resulted in higher netbacks for producers. The capacity from these initiatives was for the most part exhausted by the end of 2017 from growth in the Oil Sands and has resulted in crude differentials widening once more. Canadian pipeline export capacity is expected to remain essentially full, resulting in incremental production utilizing non-pipeline transportation services until such time as pipeline capacity is made available. As the supply in North America continues to grow, the growth and flexibility of pipeline infrastructure will need to keep pace with the sensitive demand and supply balance. Over the longer term, we believe pipelines will continue to be the most cost-effective means of transportation in markets where the differential between North American and global oil prices remain narrow. Utilization of rail to transport crude is expected to be substantially limited to those markets not readily accessible by pipelines. Our role in helping to address the evolving supply and demand fundamentals and alleviating price discounts for producers and supply costs to refiners is to provide expanded pipeline capacity and sustainable connectivity to alternative markets. As discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects, in 2017, we continue to execute our growth projects plan in furtherance of this objective.18GAS TRANSMISSION & MIDSTREAMGas Transmission and Midstream (formerly referred to as Gas Pipelines and Processing) consists of our investments in natural gas pipelines and gathering and processing facilities in Canada and the United States, including US Gas Transmission, Canadian Gas Transmission and Midstream, Alliance Pipeline, US Midstream and other assets. 19US GAS TRANSMISSIONThe majority of assets that comprise US Gas Transmission were acquired through the Merger Transaction and consist of natural gas transmission and storage assets that are held primarily through Spectra Energy Partners, LP (SEP). US Gas Transmission includes indirect ownership interests in Texas Eastern, Algonquin, M&N U.S., East Tennessee Natural Gas, Gulfstream, Sabal Trail, Vector Pipeline L.P. (Vector) and certain other gas pipeline and storage assets. The US Gas Transmission business primarily provides transmission and storage of natural gas through interstate pipeline systems for customers in various regions of the midwestern, northeastern and southern United States.As a result of the Merger Transaction, Enbridge held a 75% equity interest in SEP, a natural gas and crude oil infrastructure master limited partnership. As a result of us converting all of our incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and general partner economic interests in SEP into 172.5 million newly issued SEP common units, we now hold a 83% equity interest in SEP. Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - United States Sponsored Vehicle Strategy.

COMPETITIONOur natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The flow pattern of natural gas is changing across North America due to emerging supply sources and evolving demand centers, which creates a highly competitive market to secure new growth opportunities. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other 22forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.Competition in our business exists in all of the markets we serve. Competitors include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies. Pipelines typically compete with each other based on location, capacity, reputation, price and reliability.SUPPLY AND DEMAND Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 30 percent by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. Natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand as gas consumption is anticipated to grow by nearly 50 percent during this period as one of the world’s fastest growing energy sources, second only to renewables. Globally, most natural gas demand will stem from the need for greater power generation capacity, as natural gas is a cleaner alternative to coal, which currently has the largest market share for power generation. Within North America, United States natural gas demand growth is expected to be driven by the next wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities which are now starting to enter service, along with power generation, an increase in the volume of LNG exports and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Within Canada, natural gas demand growth is expected to be largely tied to oil sands development and growth in gas-fired power generation. Canadian gas demand growth will be accelerated with implementation of proposed government regulations to replace coal fired power, designed to meet emissions targets. North American supply from tight formations continues to create a demand and supply imbalance for natural gas and some NGL products. North American gas supply continues to be significantly impacted by development in the northeastern United States, primarily the prolific Marcellus and Utica shales in Appalachia. The abundance of supply from these shale plays continues to alter natural gas flow patterns in North America, as this region has largely displaced flows from the Gulf Coast and WCSB that historically supplied eastern markets. Similar pressures are also being felt in the Midwest United States and southern markets.Beyond growing Appalachian production, natural gas supply growth has been largely tied to crude oil and NGL production. In the Permian Basin, for example, rapid expansion of crude oil drilling activity has increased associated gas supplies from the region by approximately 2.0 bcf/d over the past two years and growth is forecasted to continue for the next decade. Similarly, WCSB natural gas production growth has been primarily attributable to production of NGLs, which provide strong producer netbacks. However, growing local demand from gas-fired power generation and continued oil sands development should stabilize WCSB natural gas economics, even as regional exports face steeper competition in Eastern Canada and the Midwest United States. The continued increase in North American gas production and the resulting surplus supply has limited gas price advances, which remained largely within range throughout 2017. In response to low prices, producers have introduced new technologies and more efficient drilling and completion techniques to maximize production and improve break-even economics on new wells. While domestic gas demand and growing North American gas exports provide support for future prices, abundant low cost supplies are likely to continue to limit high prices through the next decade. Growth in global demand for natural gas will necessitate growing LNG trade to facilitate the movement of gas supply from producing regions to consuming regions. North America and the USGC in particular are positioned to benefit from this trend as low-cost tight gas production from the Permian, Eagle Ford and Appalachia continues to enable growing LNG exports. The United States exported approximately 3.0 bcf/23d of natural gas from the United States Gulf Coast at the end of 2017 with export capacity of approximately 9.0 bcf/d scheduled to be in service by 2020. While the short term outlook for LNG fundamentals points to a continued global oversupply, as the market absorbs the large volumes of new supply coming online, forecasts indicate demand will exceed projected LNG supply in the early 2020s as growing markets seek to diversify supply sources. In addition to LNG export facilities under construction, the United States remains well positioned to serve this next round of global trade expansion. Canada is well positioned to provide LNG export facilities, although these facilities are not likely to be in service in the near term. NGL production growth is increasingly linked to growing associated gas volumes related to the development of tight oil plays such as the Permian. NGLs that can be extracted from liquids-rich gas streams include ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline, which are used in a variety of industrial, commercial and other applications. Robust gas production has created regional supply imbalances for some NGL products and weakened the economics of NGL extraction, although these imbalances modestly improved over 2017 as crude prices have rebounded and NGL export capacity has expanded. Over the longer term, the growth in NGL demand is expected to be robust, driven largely by incremental ethane demand and exports. Ethane is the key feedstock to the United States Gulf Coast petrochemical industry, which is among the world’s lowest-cost ethylene producing regions and is currently undergoing significant expansion. As this new infrastructure is completed, ethane prices and resulting extraction margins are expected to improve, reducing the amount of ethane retained in the gas stream. In addition to ethane, the outlook for abundant propane supplies has prompted the development and expansion of export facilities for liquefied petroleum gas. Over a few short years, the United States has become the world’s largest liquefied petroleum gas exporter, which has helped to reduce the inventory overhang and provide support for propane prices. In Canada, the WCSB is well situated to capitalize on the evolving NGL fundamentals over the longer term as the Montney and Duvernay shale plays contain significant liquids-rich resources at highly competitive extraction costs. In response to growing regional NGL supply, several propane export solutions are being developed to move WCSB NGLs from Western Canada to global markets. Longer term, NGL fundamentals indicate a positive outlook for demand growth and would be further supported with a continued recovery in crude oil prices. Consequently, the crude-to-gas price ratio is expected to remain well above energy conversion value levels and continue to be supportive of NGL extraction over the longer term. In response to these evolving natural gas and NGL fundamentals, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to producers. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investment in Canadian and United States gas pipeline and midstream facilities.24GAS DISTRIBUTIONGas Distribution consists of our natural gas utility operations, the core of which are Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. (EGD) and Union Gas Limited (Union Gas), which serve residential, commercial and industrial customers, primarily located throughout Ontario. This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Quebec and New Brunswick and our investment in Noverco Inc (Noverco).On November 2, 2017, EGD and Union Gas filed an application with the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) to amalgamate the two utilities. If approved as filed, the application will provide a 10 year framework for the utilities to identify and leverage best practices and implement integrated solutions. A decision is expected in the second half of 2018. ENBRIDGE GAS DISTRIBUTIONEGD is a rate‑regulated natural gas distribution utility serving approximately 2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in its franchise areas of central and eastern Ontario. In addition, EGD currently serves areas in northern New York State through St. Lawrence Gas Company Inc. (St. Lawrence Gas). In August 2017, EGD entered into an agreement to sell the issued and outstanding shares of St. Lawrence Gas. The transaction is expected to close in 2018, subject to regulatory approval and certain pre-closing conditions.EGD also owns and operates regulated and unregulated natural gas storage facilities in Ontario. The utility business is conducted under statutes and municipal bylaws which grant the right to operate in the areas served. The utility operations of EGD and St. Lawrence Gas are regulated by the OEB and by the New York State Public Service Commission, respectively. As at December 31, 2017, EGD owned and operated a network of approximately 39,000-kilometers (24,233-miles) of mains for the transportation and distribution of natural gas, as well as the service pipes to transfer natural gas from mains to meters on customers' premises.There are four principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which EGD is directly involved: Distribution Service, Gas Supply, Transportation and Storage.25Distribution ServiceEGD's principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis (without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract). The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts.Gas SupplyTo acquire the necessary volume of natural gas to serve its customers, EGD maintains a diversified natural gas supply portfolio. EGD's system supply natural gas contracts have pricing structures responsive to supply and demand conditions in the North American natural gas market. The prices in these contracts may be indexed to Alberta, Chicago or New York based prices.TransportationEGD relies on its long-term contracts with Union Gas, an affiliated company under common control, for transportation of natural gas from the Dawn Hub (Dawn), the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada and one of the largest in North America, located in south-western Ontario, to EGD’s major market in the Greater Toronto Area. These contracts effectively provide EGD with access to United States sourced natural gas at Dawn. These contracts also provide transportation for natural gas received at Dawn via Vector as well as natural gas stored at EGD’s and Union’s storage pools in the Sarnia, Ontario area to the market area.StorageEGD’s business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits EGD to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off‑peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice permits EGD to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing its overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to EGD's franchise area. EGD's principal storage facilities are located in south-western Ontario, near Dawn, and have a total working capacity of approximately 10.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Approximately 8.5 Bcf of the total working capacity is available to EGD for utility operations. EGD also has a storage contract with Union Gas for 2.0 Bcf of storage capacity.UNION GASUnion Gas is a rate‑regulated natural gas distribution utility now serving approximately 1.5 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in its franchise areas of northern, southwestern and eastern Ontario. Union Gas' regulated and unregulated storage and transmission business offers storage and transmission services to customers at Dawn. It offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canada and United States supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeastern United States. The utility business is conducted under statutes and municipal by‑laws which grant the right to operate in the areas served. The utility operations of Union Gas are regulated by the OEB.As at December 31, 2017, Union Gas owned and operated a network of approximately 66,000-kilometers (41,010-miles) of mains for the transportation and distribution of natural gas, as well as the service pipes to transfer natural gas from mains to meters on customers' premises.Similar to EGD, there are four principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which Union Gas is directly involved: Distribution Service, Gas Supply, Transportation and Storage.26Distribution ServiceSimilar to EGD, Union Gas’ principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis (without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract). The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers underpinned by firm or interruptible service contracts.Gas SupplyTo acquire the necessary volume of natural gas to serve its customers, Union Gas maintains a diversified natural gas supply portfolio. Union Gas' system supply natural gas contracts have pricing structures responsive to supply and demand conditions in the North American natural gas market. The prices in these contracts may be indexed to Alberta, Michigan and Chicago based prices.Transportation Union Gas’ transmission system consists of approximately 4,900-kilometers (3,045-miles) of high-pressure pipeline and five mainline compressor stations. Key pipeline interconnects in Canada and the United States enabled Union Gas to deliver approximately 774 Bcf of gas through Union Gas’ transmission system in 2017. Union Gas’ transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at Dawn to major Canadian and United States markets. There are multiple pipelines providing access to Dawn. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible transportation services on the Union Gas system. As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario continues to grow, there is an increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. To secure the continued reliable delivery of natural gas and to serve a growing demand for natural gas, Union Gas has invested $1.5 billion between 2015 and 2017 to expand the Dawn-Parkway natural gas transmission system. This has increased the takeaway capacity from Dawn to approximately 20 percent or from 6.3 bcf/d in 2014 to more than 7.5 bcf/d in 2017. A substantial amount of Union Gas’ transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately 11 years, with the longest remaining contract term being 15 years. StorageUnion Gas’ underground natural gas storage facilities have a working capacity of approximately 165 Bcf in 25 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. Union Gas’ storage pools give customers access to all Dawn storage capacity and deliverability. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. During 2017, Dawn provided storage, balancing, gas loans, transport, exchange and peaking services to over 140 counterparties.A substantial amount of Union Gas’ storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately five years, with the longest remaining contract term being 19 years.NOVERCOWe own an equity interest in Noverco through ownership of 38.9% of its common shares and an investment in preferred shares. Noverco is a holding company that owns approximately 71% of Energir LP, formerly known as Gaz Metro Limited Partnership, a natural gas distribution company operating in the province of Quebec with interests in subsidiary companies operating gas transmission, gas distribution and power distribution businesses in the Province of Quebec and the State of Vermont. Noverco also holds, directly and indirectly, an investment in our Common Shares.27OTHER GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGEOther Gas Distribution and Storage includes natural gas distribution utility operations in the Provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec.Enbridge Gas New Brunswick Inc. operates the natural gas distribution franchise in the Province of New Brunswick, has approximately 11,800 customers and is regulated by the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board (EUB).Gazifere is one of two distributors in Quebec serving more than 40,000 residential, commercial, institutional and industrial customers. Gazifere is regulated by the Quebec Regie de l’energie.28GREEN POWER & TRANSMISSIONGreen Power and Transmission consists of our investments in renewable energy assets and transmission facilities. Renewable energy assets consist of wind, solar, geothermal and waste heat recovery facilities and are located in Canada primarily in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Quebec and in the United States primarily in Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia. We also have assets under development located in Europe.29Green Power and Transmission includes approximately 2,500 MW of net operating renewable and alternative energy sources. Of this amount, approximately 930 MW of net power generating capacity comes from wind farms located in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Quebec and approximately 1,040 MW of net power generating capacity comes from wind farms located in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia, including the 249 MW Chapman Ranch Wind Project (Chapman Ranch) in Texas, which was placed into service in late October 2017. The vast majority of the power produced from these wind farms is sold under long-term power purchase agreements. We also have three solar facilities located in Ontario and a solar facility located in Nevada, with 100 MW and 50 MW, respectively, of net power generating capacity. Also included in Green Power and Transmission is the Montana-Alberta Tie-Line, our first power transmission asset, a 300 MW transmission line from Great Falls, Montana to Lethbridge, Alberta.In June 2017, we announced an additional 112 MW of investment in the partnership that holds the 610 MW Hohe See Offshore Wind Project in Germany, where we have an effective 50% interest. Earlier in 2016, we announced the acquisition of Chapman Ranch, as well as the acquisition of a 50% interest in a French offshore wind development company, Éolien Maritime France SAS. Chapman Ranch was subsequently placed into service in late October 2017. In late 2015, we announced acquisitions of the 103-MW New Creek Wind Project in West Virginia and a 24.9% interest in the 400 MW Rampion Offshore Wind Project in the United Kingdom. Including these acquisitions, we have invested over $5 billion in renewable power generation and transmission since 2002.CompetitionOur Green Power and Transmission assets operate in the North American and European power markets, which are subject to competition and the supply and demand balance for power in the provinces and states in which they operate. The renewable energy market sector includes large utilities and small independent power producers, which are expected to aggressively compete with us for project development opportunities.Supply and DemandThe power generation and transmission network in North America is expected to undergo significant growth over the next 20 years. On the demand side, North American economic growth over the longer term is expected to drive growing electricity demand, although continued efficiency gains are expected to make the economy less energy-intensive and temper demand growth. On the supply side, impending legislation in Canada is expected to accelerate the retirement of aging coal-fired generation plants, resulting in a requirement for significant new generation capacity. While coal and nuclear facilities will continue to be core components of power generation in North America, gas-fired and renewable energy facilities, including biomass, hydro, solar and wind, are expected to be the preferred sources to replace coal-fired generation due to their lower carbon intensities. North American wind and solar resources fundamentals remain strong. In the United States, there is over 85 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind power capacity and in Canada over 12 GW of installed wind power capacity. Solar resources in southwestern states such as Arizona, California and Nevada are considered to be some of the best in the world for large-scale solar plants and the United States currently has over 35 GW of installed solar photovoltaic capacity. In late 2015, the United States passed legislation extending the availability of certain Federal tax incentives which have supported the profitability of wind and solar projects. However, expanding renewable energy infrastructure in North America is not without challenges. Growing renewable generation capacity is expected to necessitate substantial capital investment to upgrade existing transmission systems or, in many cases, build new transmission lines, as these high quality wind and solar resources are often found in regions that are not in close proximity to markets. In the near-term, uncertainty over the availability of tax or other government incentives in various jurisdictions, the ability to secure long-term power purchase agreements through government or investor-owned power authorities and low market prices of electricity may hinder the pace of future new renewable capacity development. However, continued improvement in technology and manufacturing capacity in the past few years has reduced capital costs associated with renewable energy infrastructure and has also 30improved yield factors of power generation assets. These positive developments are expected to render renewable energy more competitive and support ongoing investment over the long term. In Europe, the future outlook for renewable energy, especially from offshore wind in countries with long coastlines and densely populated areas, is very positive. According to the European Wind Energy Association, by 2030, wind energy capacity in Europe is expected to be 320 GW, including 66 GW of offshore capacity. There is also wide public support for carbon reduction targets and broader adoption of renewable generation across all governmental levels. Furthermore, governments in Europe are seeking to rationalize the contribution of nuclear power to the overall energy mix, which has resulted in an increased focus on alternative sources such as large scale offshore wind.ENERGY SERVICESThe Energy Services businesses in Canada and the United States undertake physical commodity marketing activity and logistical services, oversee refinery supply services and manage our volume commitments on various pipeline systems.Energy Services provides energy supply and marketing services to North American refiners, producers and other customers. Crude oil and NGL marketing services are provided by Tidal Energy Marketing Inc. (Tidal). We transact at many North American market hubs and provides our customers with various services, including transportation, storage, supply management, hedging programs and product exchanges. Tidal is primarily a physical barrel marketing company focused on capturing value from quality, time and location differentials when opportunities arise. To execute these strategies, Energy Services may lease storage or rail cars, as well as hold nomination or contractual rights on both third party and Enbridge-owned pipelines and storage facilities. Tidal also provides natural gas and power marketing services, including marketing natural gas to optimize commitments on certain natural gas pipelines. Additionally, Tidal provides natural gas supply, transportation, balancing and storage for third parties, leveraging its natural gas marketing expertise and access to transportation capacity.CompetitionEnergy Services earnings are generated from arbitrage opportunities which, by their nature, can be replicated by other competitors. An increase in market participants entering into similar arbitrage transactions could have an impact on our earnings. Our efforts to mitigate competition risk includes diversification of our marketing business by trading at the majority of major hubs in North America and establishing long-term relationships with clients.ELIMINATIONS AND OTHEREliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs and foreign exchange costs which are not allocated to business segments. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and general corporate investments.INSURANCEOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in our industry. Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We maintain a comprehensive insurance program for us, our subsidiaries and our affiliates. This program includes insurance coverage in types and amounts and with terms and conditions that are generally consistent with coverage customary for our industry.Although we believe our current coverage is adequate for our purposes, we have in the past had occurrences that led to losses exceeding our then-applicable coverage limits, and there is no assurance 31that the same may not happen in the future. In the unlikely event that multiple insurable incidents which in aggregate exceed coverage limits occur within the same insurance period, the total insurance coverage will be allocated among our entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement among us and our subsidiaries.OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC REGULATIONLIQUIDS PIPELINESOperational RegulationOperational regulation risks relate to compliance with applicable operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs. Regulatory scrutiny over the integrity of liquids pipeline assets has the potential to increase operating costs or limit future projects. Potential regulatory changes could have an impact on our future earnings and the cost related to the construction of new projects. We believe operational regulation risk is mitigated by active monitoring and consulting on potential regulatory requirement changes with the respective regulators or through industry associations. We also develop robust response plans to regulatory changes or enforcement actions. While we believe the safe and reliable operation of our assets and adherence to existing regulations is the best approach to managing operational regulatory risk, the potential remains for regulators to make unilateral decisions that could have a financial impact on us. In the United States, our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines. These laws and regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. The regulations determine the pressures at which our pipelines can operate.PHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. Additionally, PHMSA will establish standards for storage facilities. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition and cash flows.In Canada, our pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations overseen by the NEB or provincial regulators. Applicable legislation and regulation require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. Among other obligations, this regulatory framework imposes requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. As in the United States, several legislative changes addressing pipeline safety in Canada have recently come into force. The changes evidence an increased focus on the implementation of management systems to address key areas such as emergency management, integrity management, safety, security and environmental protection. Other legislative changes have created authority for the NEB to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance with the regulatory regime it administers, as well as to impose financial requirements for future abandonment and major pipeline releases. 32We are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. In particular, in the United States, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs is likely to cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance. Some states in which we operate are implementing new emissions limits to comply with 2008 ozone standards regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, the ozone standards were lowered even further from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb, which may require states to implement additional emissions regulations. The precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes. In addition, compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs is likely to significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels.In the United States, climate change action is evolving at state, regional and federal levels. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 established that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to federal regulations, we are currently subject to an obligation to report our GHG emissions at our largest emitting facilities, but are not generally subject to limits on emissions of GHGs, (except to the extent that some GHGs consist of volatile organic compounds and nitrous oxides that are subject to emission limits). In addition, a number of provinces and states have joined regional GHG initiatives, and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in GHG emissions. Public interest groups and regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on the emission of methane associated with natural gas development and transmission as a source of GHG emissions. However, as the key details of future GHG restrictions and compliance mechanisms remain undefined, the likely future effects on our business are highly uncertain. For its part, Canada has reaffirmed its strong preference for a harmonized approach with that of the United States. While federal GHG related regulatory design details remain forthcoming, provincial authorities have been actively pursuing related initiatives.Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting our operating assets. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations or the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations could result in a material increase in our cost of compliance with such laws and regulations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operating assets or development projects. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, if we fail to obtain or comply with them, or if environmental laws or regulations change or are administered in a more stringent manner, the operations of facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented, delayed or become subject to additional costs. We expect that costs we incur to comply with environmental regulations in the future will have a significant effect on our earnings and cash flows. Due to the speculative outlook regarding any United States federal and state policies, we cannot estimate the potential effect of proposed GHG policies on our future consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, such legislation or regulation could materially increase our operating costs, require material capital expenditures or create additional permitting, which could delay proposed construction projects. Economic RegulationOur liquids pipelines also face economic regulatory risk. Broadly defined, economic regulation risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies change or reject proposed or existing commercial arrangements including permits and regulatory approvals for new projects. The Canadian Mainline, Lakehead System and other liquids pipelines are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the 33NEB and FERC, with respect to the tariffs and tolls of those operations. The changing or rejecting of commercial arrangements, including decisions by regulators on the applicable tariff structure or changes in interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. Delays in regulatory approvals on projects such as our L3R Program, could result in cost escalations and construction delays, which also negatively impact our operations. We believe that economic regulatory risk is reduced through the negotiation of long-term agreements with shippers that govern the majority of our liquids pipeline assets. We also involve our legal and regulatory teams in the review of new projects to ensure compliance with applicable regulations as well as in the establishment of tariffs and tolls on new and existing pipelines. However, despite our efforts to mitigate economic regulation risk, there remains a risk that a regulator could overturn long-term agreements that we have entered into with shippers or deny the approval and permits for new projects. GAS TRANSMISSION & MIDSTREAMOperational RegulationThe span of regulatory risks that apply to the Liquids Pipeline business as described above under Liquids Pipelines also applies to the Gas Transmission and Midstream business. Additionally, most of our United States gas transmission operations are regulated by the FERC. The FERC regulates natural gas transmission in United States interstate commerce including the establishment of rates for services. The FERC also regulates the construction of United States interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, including the extension, enlargement and abandonment of facilities. In addition, certain operations are subject to oversight by state regulatory commissions. To the extent that the natural gas intrastate pipelines that transport or store natural gas in interstate commerce provide services under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, they are subject to FERC regulations. The FERC may propose and implement new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas transmission and storage companies, which remain subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect certain transmission of gas by intrastate pipelines.Our SEP and DCP Midstream operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal, state and local environmental agencies. Our United States interstate natural gas pipelines and certain of DCP Midstream’s gathering and transmission pipelines are also subject to the regulations of the DOT concerning pipeline safety.The intrastate natural gas and NGL pipelines owned by us and DCP Midstream are subject to state regulation. The natural gas gathering and processing activities of DCP Midstream are not subject to FERC regulation.Our Canadian operations are governed by various federal and provincial agencies with respect to pipeline safety, including the NEB and the Transportation Safety Board, the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission, the Alberta Energy Regulator and the Ontario Technical Standards and Safety Authority.Our Canadian natural gas transmission and distribution operations and approximately two-thirds of the storage operations in Canada are subject to regulation by the NEB or the provincial agencies in Canada, such as the OEB. These agencies have jurisdiction similar to the FERC for regulating rates, the terms and conditions of service, the construction of additional facilities and acquisitions. Our British Columbia Pipeline and British Columbia Field Services business in western Canada is regulated by the NEB pursuant to a framework for light-handed regulation under which the NEB acts on a complaints-basis for rates associated with that business. Similarly, the rates charged by our Canadian Gas Transmission and Midstream operations for gathering and processing services in western Canada are regulated on a complaints-basis by applicable provincial regulators.34GAS DISTRIBUTIONEconomic RegulationOur gas distribution utility operations are regulated by the OEB and the EUB among others. Regulators’ future actions may differ from current expectations, or future legislative changes may impact the regulatory environments in which we operate. To the extent that the regulators’ future actions are different from current expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or refund of amounts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or that would have been recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in absence of the effects of regulation, could be different from the amounts that are eventually recovered or refunded.We seek to mitigate economic regulation risk. We retain dedicated professional staff and maintain strong relationships with customers, intervenors and regulators. The terms of rate negotiations are reviewed by our legal, regulatory and finance teams.Enbridge Gas DistributionDistribution rates are set under a five-year customized incentive rate plan (IR Plan) approved in 2014 and provide a level of stability by having a long-term agreement with the OEB which allows us to recover our expected capital investments under the agreement, as well as an opportunity to earn above the OEB allowed ROE. Under the customized IR Plan, we are permitted to recover, with OEB approval, certain costs that were beyond management control, but that were necessary for the maintenance of our services. The customized IR Plan also includes a mechanism to reassess the customized IR Plan and return to cost of service if there are significant and unanticipated developments that threaten the sustainability of the customized IR Plan.Union GasDistribution rates, beginning in 2014, are set under a five-year incentive regulation framework using price cap methodology. The price cap framework establishes new rates at the beginning of each year through the use of a pricing formula rather than through the examination of revenue and cost forecasts. The framework allows for annual inflationary rate increases, offset by a productivity factor, as well as rate increases or decreases in the small volume customer classes where use declines or increases, and certain adjustments to base rates. Further, it allows for the continued pass-through of gas commodity, upstream transportation and demand side management costs, the additional pass-through of costs associated with major capital investments and certain fuel variances, an allowance for unexpected cost changes that are outside of management’s control, and equal sharing of tax changes between Union Gas and customers, and finally an opportunity to earn above the OEB allowed ROE.Environmental RegulationOur workers, operations and facilities are subject to municipal, provincial and federal legislation which regulate the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers. For the environment, primarily this includes the regulation of discharges to air, land and water; the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and contaminated soil and groundwater; and the assessment of contaminated sites.The operation of our gas distribution system and gas facilities comes with risk of incidents, abnormal operating conditions or other unplanned events that could result in spills or emissions to the environment that could exceed permitted levels. These events could result in injuries to workers or the public, fines, penalties, adverse impacts to the environment in which we operate within, and/or property damage. We could also incur future liability for environmental (soil and groundwater) contamination associated with past and present site activities.In addition to the operation of the gas distribution system, we also operate unregulated operations including small oil and brine production and storage facilities in southwestern Ontario. Environmental risk associated with these facilities is the possibility of spills, releases or leaks. In the event of an incident (spill), remediation of the affected area would be required. There would also be potential for fines, orders 35or charges under environmental legislation, and potential third-party liability claims by affected land owners.The gas distribution system and our other operations must maintain a number of environmental approvals and permits from governmental authorities to operate. As a result, these facilities and the distribution network are subject to periodic inspection. An Annual Written Summary Report is submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) to demonstrate we are in good standing in relation to its Environmental Compliance Approvals. Failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in operational interruptions, fines, penalties, and/or orders for additional pollution control technology or environmental remediation, etc. As environmental requirements and regulations become more stringent, the cost to maintain compliance and the time required to obtain approvals has consistently increased.Ontario commenced a cap and trade system on January 1, 2017. Under the cap and trade regulation, EGD and Union Gas (together, the Utilities) are required to purchase emission allowances or credits for most of our customers’ use of natural gas as well as for emissions from our own operations. This process is complex and requires ongoing monitoring of the carbon market and related climate change and carbon policies not only in Ontario but also in other newly linked jurisdictions as at January 1, 2018 - namely California and Quebec. This linkage which has been enabled in Ontario with various GHG reporting and cap and trade regulation amendments over the course of 2017 will create a larger and more liquid market for carbon allowances and credits, which may help to keep compliance costs for our customers down. However, non-compliance or unexpected policy changes may cause significant changes to the cost of maintaining compliance and needs to be closely monitored to ensure impacts are understood.As required by the OEB Cap and Trade Framework, the Utilities each submitted 2017 Compliance Plans, which subsequently received supportive endorsement and approval of cost recovery in 2017 rates. The Utilities are in the process of defending their individually filed 2018 Compliance Plans. The OEB approved use of the 2017 final rate for recovery of 2018 cap and trade compliance costs until determined otherwise. Further, the OEB Cap and Trade Framework identifies that the Utilities are expected to file 2019/2020 Compliance Plans as well as an Annual Report summarizing 2017 results by August 1, 2018. The Compliance Plans detail how the Utilities will meet their respective carbon compliance obligations through carbon allowance and/or offset procurement as well as through customer and facility abatement projects that may be deemed cost effective. By creating prudent and thoughtful plans and executing with excellence, the Utilities can best mitigate the risk of cost disallowance. As with previous years, in 2017 the Utilities each reported GHG emissions to the Ontario MOECC, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and a number of voluntary reporting programs. Emissions from Ontario combustion sources were verified in detail by a third party accredited verifier with no material discrepancies found. Additionally, operational emissions from venting, fugitive and natural gas distribution emissions were reported to the MOECC for the first time in 2017 in accordance with O. Reg. 143/16 - Quantification, Reporting, and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation standard quantification methods ON. 350 and ON. 400, respectively. The Utilities continue to monitor developments and attend stakeholder consultations in Ontario.The Utilities utilize emissions data management processes and systems to help with the data capture and mandatory and voluntary reporting needs. Quantification methodologies and emission factors will continually be updated in the system as required. Each Utility publicly reports its GHG emissions and has developed internal procedures for more frequent monthly Cap and Trade related GHG reporting. Collectively, the Utilities continue to work with industry associations to refine quantification methodologies and emissions factors, as well as best management practices to minimize emissions. The Utilities plans to reduce emissions in 2018 are outlined in the Facility Abatement Plan within their respective Compliance Plans.36EMPLOYEESWe had approximately 12,700 employees as at December 31, 2017, including approximately 8,500 employees in Canada. Approximately 1,800 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us. Approximately 48% of those employees are covered under agreements that either have expired or will expire by December 31, 2018. We are currently going through the process of collective bargaining in respect to the expired or expiring contracts. We have mature working relationships with our labor unions and the parties have traditionally committed themselves to the achievement of renewal agreements without a work stoppage.EXECUTIVES AND OTHER OFFICERSThe following table sets forth information regarding our executive and other officers.NameAgePositionAl Monaco58President & Chief Executive OfficerJohn K.

RISK FACTORSExecution of our capital projects subjects us to various regulatory, development, operational and market risks that may affect our financial results. Our ability to successfully execute the development of our organic growth projects is subject to various regulatory, development, operational and market risks, including: •the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits from governments and regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms and to maintain those issued approvals and permits and satisfy the terms and conditions imposed therein; •potential changes in federal, state, provincial and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that may prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; •impediments on our ability to acquire or renew rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; •opposition to our projects by third parties, including special interest groups; •the availability of skilled labor, equipment and materials to complete projects; •the ability to construct projects within anticipated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials or labor, contractor or supplier non-performance, weather, geologic conditions or other factors beyond our control, that may be material; •general economic factors that affect the demand for our projects; and •the ability to raise financing for these capital projects. Any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated cost. Recent projects that have experienced delays include the United States portion of the L3R Program (U.S. L3R Program) and NEXUS. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined Northern Gateway could not proceed as envisioned. New projects may not achieve their expected investment return, which could affect our financial results, and hinder our ability to secure future projects. Cyber-attacks or security breaches could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Our business is dependent upon information systems and other digital technologies for controlling our plants and pipelines, processing transactions and summarizing and reporting results of operations. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of information is critical to our operations. A security breach of our network or systems could result in improper operation of our assets, potentially including delays in the delivery or availability of our customers’ products, contamination or degradation of the products we transport, store or distribute, or releases of hydrocarbon products for which we could be held liable. Furthermore, we collect and store sensitive data in the ordinary course of our business, including personal identification information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders. We have a cyber-security controls framework in place which has been derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber-security Framework and International Organization for Standardization 27001 standards. We monitor our control effectiveness in an increasing threat landscape and continuously take action to improve our security posture. We have implemented a 7X24 security operations center to monitor, detect and investigate any anomalous activity in our network together with an incident response process that we test on a monthly basis. We conduct independent cyber-security audits and penetration tests on a regular basis to test that our preventative and detective controls are working as designed. Despite our security measures, our information systems may become the target of cyber-attacks or security breaches (including employee error, malfeasance or other breaches), which could compromise our network or systems and result in the release or loss of the information stored therein, misappropriation of assets, disruption to our operations or damage to our facilities. Our current insurance coverage programs do not 40contain specific coverage for cyber-attacks or security breaches. As a result of a cyber-attack or security breach, we could also be liable under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, subject to regulatory penalties, experience damage to our reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in our products and services, or incur additional costs for remediation and modification or enhancement of our information systems to prevent future occurrences, all of which could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Changes in our reputation with stakeholders, special interest groups, political leadership, the media or other entities could have negative impacts on our business, operations or financial results. There could be negative impacts on our business, operations or financial results due to changes in our reputation with stakeholders, special interest groups (including non-governmental organizations), political leadership, the media or other entities. Public opinion may be influenced by certain media and special interest groups’ negative portrayal of the industry in which we operate as well as their opposition to development projects, such as the Bakken Pipeline System. Potential impacts of a negative public opinion may include: •loss of business; •loss of ability to secure growth opportunities; •delays in project execution; •legal action; •increased regulatory oversight or delays in regulatory approval; and •loss of ability to hire and retain top talent. We are also exposed to the risk of higher costs, delays or even project cancellations due to increasing pressure on governments and regulators by special interest groups. Recent judicial decisions have increased the ability of special interest groups to make claims and oppose projects in regulatory and legal forums. In addition to issues raised by groups focused on particular project impacts, we and others in the energy and pipeline businesses are facing opposition from organizations opposed to oil sands development and shipment of production from oil sands regions. Pipeline operations involve numerous risks that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Operation of complex pipeline systems, gathering, treating, storing and processing operations involves many risks, hazards and uncertainties. These events include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides or other similar events beyond our control. These types of catastrophic events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of our operations, any of which could also result in substantial losses for which insurance may not be sufficient or available and for which we may bear a part or all of the cost. We have experienced such events in the past, including in 2010 on Lines 6A and 6B Lakehead System. which is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legal and Other Updates. In addition, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties from regulators in connection with such events. Environmental incidents could also lead to an increased cost of operating and insuring our assets, thereby negatively impacting earnings. An environmental incident could have lasting reputational impacts to us and could impact our ability to work with various stakeholders. For pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas, including residential communities, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering locations, the level of damage resulting from these catastrophic events could be greater. 41Our assets vary in age and were constructed over many decades which may cause our inspection, maintenance or repair costs to increase in the future. Our pipelines vary in age and were constructed over many decades. Pipelines are generally long-lived assets, and pipeline construction and coating techniques have changed over time. Depending on the era of construction, some assets require more frequent inspections, which could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures in the future. Any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. A service interruption could have a significant impact on our operations, and negatively impact financial results, relationships with stakeholders and our reputation. A service interruption due to a major power disruption or curtailment of commodity supply could have a significant impact on our operations and negatively impact financial results, relationships with stakeholders and our reputation. Specifically, for Gas Distribution, any prolonged interruptions would ultimately impact gas distribution customers. Service interruptions that impact our crude oil transportation services can negatively impact shippers’ operations and earnings as they are dependent on our services to move their product to market or fulfill their own contractual arrangements. Our operations involve safety risks to the public and to our workers and contractors. Several of our pipelines and distribution systems and related assets are operated in close proximity to populated areas and a major incident could result in injury to members of the public. In addition, given the natural hazards inherent in our operations, our workers and contractors are subject to personal safety risks. A public safety incident or an injury to our workers or contractors could result in reputational damage to us, material repair costs or increased costs of operating and insuring our assets. Our transformation projects may fail to fully deliver anticipated results. We launched projects in 2016 to transform various processes, capabilities and reporting systems infrastructure to continuously improve effectiveness and efficiency across the organization. Transformation project risk is the risk that modernization projects carried out by us and our subsidiaries do not fully deliver anticipated results due to insufficiently addressing the risks associated with project execution and change management. This could result in negative financial, operational and reputational impacts.An impairment of our assets, including goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments, could reduce our earnings. GAAP requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. The outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our goodwill, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments. Additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if such assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings. There are utilization risks in respect to our assets. In respect to our Liquids Pipeline assets, we are exposed to throughput risk under the CTS on the Canadian Mainline and under certain tolling agreements applicable to other Liquids Pipelines assets, such as the Lakehead System. A decrease in volumes transported can directly and adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Factors such as changing market fundamentals, capacity bottlenecks, operational incidents, regulatory restrictions, system maintenance and increased competition can all 42impact the utilization of our assets. Market fundamentals, such as commodity prices and price differentials, weather, gasoline price and consumption, alternative energy sources and global supply disruptions outside of our control can impact both the supply of and demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons transported on our pipelines. In respect to our Gas Transmission and Midstream assets, gas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of non-conventional shale gas supplies. The increase in natural gas supply has resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, wet gas areas with higher NGL content which depressed activity in dry fields. This, in turn, has contributed to a resulting oversupply of pipeline takeaway capacity in some areas, which can adversely affect our revenues and earnings. In respect to our Gas Distribution assets, customers are billed on a combination of both fixed charge and volumetric basis and EGD and Union Gas' ability to collect their respective total revenue requirement (the cost of providing service, including a reasonable return to the utility) depends on achieving the forecast distribution volume established in the rate-making process. The probability of realizing such volume is contingent upon four key forecast variables: weather, economic conditions, pricing of competitive energy sources and growth in the number of customers. Weather is a significant driver of delivery volumes, given that a significant portion of EGD and Union Gas' respective customer base uses natural gas for space heating. Distribution volume may also be impacted by the increased adoption of energy efficient technologies, along with more efficient building construction, that continue to place downward pressure on consumption. In addition, conservation efforts by customers may further contribute to a decline in annual average consumption. EGD and Union Gas have deferral accounts approved by the OEB that provide regulatory protection against the margin impacts associated with declining annual average consumption due to efficiencies and customers’ conservation efforts. Sales and transportation service to large volume commercial and industrial customers is more susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. As well, the pricing of competitive energy sources affects volume distributed to these sectors as some customers have the ability to switch to an alternate fuel. Even in those circumstances where EGD and Union Gas each attains their respective total forecast distribution volume, they may not earn their respective expected ROE due to other forecast variables, such as the mix between the higher margin residential and commercial sectors and the lower margin industrial sector. EGD and Union Gas each remain at risk for the actual versus forecast large volume contract commercial and industrial volumes.In respect to our Green Power and Transmission assets, earnings from these assets are highly dependent on weather and atmospheric conditions as well as continued operational availability of these energy producing assets. While the expected energy yields for Green Power and Transmission projects are predicted using long-term historical data, wind and solar resources are subject to natural variation from year to year and from season to season. Any prolonged reduction in wind or solar resources at any of the Green Power and Transmission facilities could lead to decreased earnings and cash flows for us. Additionally, inefficiencies or interruptions of Green Power and Transmission facilities due to operational disturbances or outages resulting from weather conditions or other factors, could also impact earnings. Power produced from Green Power and Transmission assets is also often sold to a single counterparty under power purchase agreements or other long-term pricing arrangements. In this respect, the performance of the Green Power and Transmission assets is dependent on each counterparty performing its contractual obligations under the power purchase agreements or pricing arrangement applicable to it. We rely on access to short-term and long-term capital markets to finance capital requirements and support liquidity needs, and cost effective access to those markets can be affected, particularly if we or our rated subsidiaries are unable to maintain an investment-grade credit rating.A significant portion of our consolidated asset base is financed with debt. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from assets. Accordingly, we rely on access to both short-term and long-term capital markets as a source of liquidity 43for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt. Our senior unsecured long-term debt is currently rated investment-grade by various rating agencies. If the rating agencies were to rate us or our rated subsidiaries below investment-grade, our borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. Consequently, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease.We maintain revolving credit facilities to provide back-up for commercial paper programs for borrowings and/or letters of credit at various entities. These facilities typically include financial covenants and failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude that entity from issuing commercial paper or letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving credit facility, which could affect cash flows or restrict business. Furthermore, if our short-term debt rating were to be downgraded, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited. Although this would not affect our ability to draw under our credit facilities, borrowing costs could be significantly higher.If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates, our ability to finance operations and implement our strategy may be affected. Restrictions on our ability to access financial markets may also affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for future growth. Any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of our subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited, which in turn could increase our need to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries, thus reducing the liquidity and borrowing availability of the consolidated group.Our forecasted assumptions may not materialize as expected on our expansion projects, acquisitions and divestitures. We evaluate expansion projects, acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis. Planning and investment analysis is highly dependent on accurate forecasting assumptions and to the extent that these assumptions do not materialize, financial performance may be lower or more volatile than expected. Volatility and unpredictability in the economy, both locally and globally, change in cost estimates, project scoping and risk assessment could result in a loss in our profits. We may not be able to sell assets or, if we are able to sell assets, to raise a sufficient amount of capital from such asset sales. In addition, the timing to enter into and close any asset sales could be significantly different than our expected timeline.We are planning to monetize certain assets to execute on our strategic priority to focus on core assets and to accelerate debt reduction and provide capital for capital and investment expenditures. Given the commodity markets, financial markets, and other challenges currently facing the energy sector, our competitors may also engage in asset sales leading to lower demand for the assets we wish to sell. We may not be able to sell the assets we identify for sale on favorable terms or at all. If we are able to sell assets, the timing of the receipt of the asset sale proceeds may not align with the timing of our capital requirements. A failure to raise sufficient capital from asset sales or a misalignment of the timing of capital raised and capital funding needs could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Our operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations and affect or limit our business plans. Many of our operations are regulated. The nature and degree of regulation and legislation affecting energy companies in Canada and the United States have changed significantly in past years and further substantial changes may occur.44On February 8, 2018, the Government of Canada introduced legislation to revise the process for assessing major resource projects. At this time, we are reviewing the proposed regulatory reforms and the effect upon us and our subsidiaries, whether adverse or favorable, if such legislation is passed in its current or revised form, is currently uncertain. Compliance with legislative changes may impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in a number of consequences which may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition and cash flows. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations and affect or limit our business plans, or expose us to environmental liabilities. We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting our operating assets. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations or the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations could result in a material increase in our cost of compliance with such laws and regulations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operating assets or development projects. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, if we fail to obtain or comply with them, or if environmental laws or regulations change or are administered in a more stringent manner, the operations of facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented, delayed or become subject to additional costs. We expect that costs we incur to comply with environmental regulations in the future will have a significant effect on our earnings and cash flows. We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers.We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment-grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or provide us security to satisfy credit concerns. A significant amount of our credit exposures for transmission, storage, and gathering and processing services are with customers who have an investment-grade rating (or the equivalent based on our evaluation) or are secured by collateral. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in our customers’ creditworthiness. As a result of future capital projects for which natural gas and oil producers may be the primary customer, our credit exposure with below investment-grade customers may increase. It is possible that customer payment defaults, if significant, could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.Our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans. Our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, including engineers, technical personnel and other professionals. We and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce. If we are unable to retain current employees and/or recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, we could experience increased allocated costs to retain and recruit these professionals. 45We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could adversely affect our financial results.We are subject to numerous legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. It is reasonably possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which we are involved could require additional expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could adversely affect our financial results.Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or acts of war, and other civil unrest or activism could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity or acts of war, or other civil unrest or activism may have significant effects on general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity, each of which could adversely affect our business. Future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States, or Canada, or military or trade disruptions may significantly affect our operations and those of our customers. Strategic targets, such as energy related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States and Canada. In addition, increased environmental activism against pipeline construction and operation could potentially result in work delays, reduced demand for our products and services, increased legislation or denial or delay of permits and rights-of-way. Finally, the disruption or a significant increase in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Our Liquids Pipelines results may be adversely affected by commodity prices. Current oil sands production is very robust and is expected to grow in the future as producers actively improve the competitiveness of their existing projects; however, prolonged low prices negatively impact producers' balance sheets and their ability to invest. Sanctioned projects due to come on stream in the next 24 months are not as sensitive to short-term declines in crude oil prices, as investment commitments have already been made. A protracted long-term outlook for low crude oil prices could result in delay or cancellation of future projects. Wide commodity price basis between Western Canada and global tidewater markets have also negatively impacted producer netbacks and margins in the past years that largely resulted from pipeline infrastructure takeaway capacity from producing regions in Western Canada and North Dakota operating at capacity. The tight oil plays of Western Canada and the Bakken region of North Dakota have short cycle break-even time horizons, typically less than 24 months, and high decline rates that can be well managed through active hedging programs and are positioned to react quickly at market signals. Accordingly, during periods of comparatively low prices, drilling programs, unsupported by hedging programs, will be reduced and as such supply growth from tight oil basins may be lower, which may impact volumes on our pipeline systems. Our Gas Transmission and Midstream results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities.Our exposure to commodity price volatility is inherent to part of our natural gas processing activities. We employ a disciplined hedging program to manage this direct commodity price risk. Because we are not fully hedged, we may be adversely impacted by commodity price exposure on the commodities we receive in-kind as payment for our gathering, processing, treating and transportation services. As a result of our unhedged exposure and the pricing of our hedge positions, a substantial decline in the prices of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results.46Additionally, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure, we likely will be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges. Our hedging activities can result in substantial losses if hedging arrangements are imperfect or ineffective and our hedging policies and procedures are not followed properly or do not work as intended. Further, hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the contracts, particularly during periods of weak and volatile economic conditions. In addition, certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. This causes periodic earnings volatility due to fluctuations in commodity prices.Our Energy Services results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility.Energy Services generates margin by capitalizing on quality, time and location differentials when opportunities arise. Volatility in commodity prices due to changing marketing conditions could limit margin opportunities and impede Energy Services' ability to cover capacity commitments. Furthermore, commodity prices could have negative earnings and cash flow impacts if the cost of the commodity is greater than resale prices achieved by us.Our risk management policies cannot eliminate all risks. In addition, any non-compliance with our risk management policies could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.We use derivative financial instruments to manage the risks associated with movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and our share price to reduce volatility to our cash flows. Based on our risk management policies, all of our derivative financial instruments are associated with an underlying asset, liability and/or forecasted transaction. We do not enter into transactions with the objective of speculating on commodity prices or interest rates. These policies cannot, however, eliminate all risk of unauthorized trading and other speculative activity. Although this activity is monitored independently by our risk management function, we remain exposed to the risk of non-compliance with our risk management policies. We can provide no assurance that our risk management function will detect and prevent all unauthorized trading and other violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception, collusion or other intentional misconduct is involved, and any such violations could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.The effects of United States Government policies on trade relations between Canada and the United States are uncertain.The United States Government has continued interest in renegotiating and altering the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. NAFTA provides protection against tariffs, duties and other charges or fees and assures access by the signatories. The NAFTA negotiations have introduced a level of uncertainty in the energy markets. The outcome of the NAFTA negotiations could result in new rules or its collapse which may be disruptive to energy markets, and could jeopardize our ability to remain competitive and have a significant impact on us. The effect of comprehensive United States tax reform legislation on us, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain.On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018” (informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). The effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on us, our subsidiaries and our shareholders, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain, but will become more clear as additional guidance is issued. 47ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESDescriptions of our properties and maps depicting the locations of our liquids and natural gas systems are included in Item 1. Business.In general, our systems are located on land owned by others and are operated under easements and rights-of-way, licenses, leases or permits that have been granted by private land owners, First Nations, Native American Tribes, public authorities, railways or public utilities. Our liquids systems have pumping stations, tanks, terminals and certain other facilities that are located on land that is owned by us and/or used by us under easements, licenses, leases or permits. Additionally, our natural gas systems have natural gas compressor stations, processing plants and treating plants, the vast majority of which are located on land that is owned by us, with the remainder used by us under easements, leases or permits.Titles to our properties acquired in our liquids and natural gas systems are subject to encumbrances in some cases. We believe that none of these burdens should materially detract from the value of these properties or materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSWe are involved in various legal and administrative proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these matters is not predictable at this time. However, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.

895728,ENB,ENBRIDGE INC,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in 2018 we made significant progress on a number of the objectives set out in the Strategic Plan. Notably:•we monetized approximately $7.8 billion of non-core assets, some of which were less aligned with our regulated pipelines and utilities business model; •we strengthened our balance sheet, achieving long-term leverage targets ahead of schedule;•we streamlined and simplified our corporate structure through buying in four publicly-traded sponsored vehicles; and7•we continued to execute on our industry-leading capital program, bringing $7 billion of new projects into service during the year and advancing our Line 3 Replacement Program (L3R Program) and other secured projects currently in progress through key regulatory milestones. As a result of the actions we took in 2018, we are entering 2019 with a streamlined business model and organizational structure, a strong balance sheet and a renewed focus on securing additional growth.While the relative degree of emphasis has shifted with the progress we made last year, our strategic priorities remain essentially unchanged as we seek to continue to grow the business and add value in pursuit of our longer term vision. The key priorities are summarized below.Commitment to Safety and Operational ReliabilitySafety and operational reliability remain the foundation of our Strategic Plan. Our commitment to safety and operational reliability means achieving and maintaining industry leadership in safety (process, public and personal) and ensuring the reliability and integrity of the systems we operate in order to generate, transport and deliver energy while protecting people and the environment. Maintain a Strong Financial PositionThe maintenance of our financial strength is critical to our strategy. Over the last year, execution of our funding plans together with selected asset divestitures have reduced consolidated leverage and strengthened our balance sheet. Our financing strategies are designed to achieve strong, investment grade credit ratings to ensure that we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs, and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions and respond to opportunities as they arise. Our current secured capital program, which extends beyond 2020, can be readily financed through internally generated cash flow and available balance sheet capacity without issuance of additional common equity, and we will seek to drive attractive growth post 2020 using this “self-funded” model. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.To reinforce our low-risk regulated pipeline and utility-like profile, we continue to closely monitor and manage controllable risks. This includes a comprehensive long-term economic hedging program to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity price on our earnings and cash flow as well as ongoing monitoring and management of credit exposures to customers, suppliers and counterparties. For further details, refer to Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Execute Capital ProgramSuccessful project execution is integral to our financial performance but also to the strategic positioning of our business over the long term. Our ongoing objective is to deliver projects on time, on budget and at the lowest practical cost while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.Complete Integration and TransformationA heightened focus on efficiency and effectiveness continues to be a key priority. Given the increasingly competitive nature of our business, in 2016 we established a goal to reach top quartile cost performance while seeking opportunities to drive enhanced revenue from our operating businesses. To achieve this, we launched several projects to transform various processes, organizational capabilities and information systems infrastructure in order to improve how we do business. Several of these initiatives have been successfully completed, while others will continue into 2019 and 2020. 8A related priority for our gas distribution business is the effective integration of the operations and management of Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. (EGD) and Union Gas Limited (Union Gas) following the amalgamation of these two large natural gas distribution utilities effective January 1, 2019. The establishment of a new five-year incentive rate making model for the combined entity provides an opportunity to increase efficiencies and enhance returns while lowering customer energy costs.Extend Growth Post 2020 Our core assets are strategically positioned between key supply basins with strong demand pull, and are underpinned by low risk commercial structures: long-term contracts, regulated cost of service tolling frameworks, established customer bases and strong risk-adjusted returns. We will remain focused on growing post 2020 through investments in these types of assets, placing an even greater emphasis on capturing the very best of a large suite of potential organic growth opportunities with an emphasis on energy export opportunities. Opportunities will be screened, analyzed and assessed using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.In seeking to extend growth post 2020, we will continue to focus on maintaining our low risk, regulated pipeline and utility business model, utilizing the self-funding model described above to grow our core business, while taking a rigorous approach to capital allocation. Starting in 2020, we expect to generate $5 to $6 billion of available capital to reinvest in the business without raising external equity and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We currently see many promising organic growth opportunities in which to deploy available capital in the post 2020 period but will actively monitor the business landscape and assess these opportunities against other alternative uses for our capital on an ongoing basis in order to ensure value maximization. MAINTAIN THE FOUNDATIONOur success in executing on our strategic priorities is very much dependent on the way in which we conduct our business and the quality and capabilities of our people. These elements provide the “foundation” required to achieve our objectives and longer term vision. Uphold Enbridge ValuesWe adhere to a strong set of core values that govern how we conduct our business and pursue strategic priorities, as articulated in our value statement: “Enbridge employees demonstrate safety, integrity and respect in support of our communities, the environment and each other”. Employees are expected to uphold these values in their interactions with each other, customers, suppliers, landowners, community members and all others with whom we deal and ensure our business decisions are consistent with these values. Employees and contractors are required, on an annual basis, to certify their compliance with our Statement on Business Conduct, which encapsulates these values.Build and Maintain the Confidence of Stakeholders and Decisions MakersEarning and sustaining the trust of our key stakeholders and decision makers is critical to our ability to execute on our growth plans and ensure that our business strategy, as well as our corporate policies and management systems, are continuously informed by the social and environmental context surrounding our projects and operations. A key priority is to establish and maintain constructive relationships with local communities and other groups directly impacted by our activities over the life-cycle of our assets. The linear nature of our energy infrastructure puts us in contact with a large number of diverse communities, landowners and regulatory bodies across North America. Because Indigenous communities have distinct rights, we have dedicated accountabilities and resources focused on Indigenous consultation and inclusion. Early identification of local concerns enables us to respond quickly and take a proactive approach to problem solving. Early engagement also enables us to provide expanded opportunities for socio-economic participation through employment, training, and procurement, as well as through the development of joint initiatives on safety, environmental and cultural protection. More broadly, our goal is to build awareness and balanced dialogue on the role and value of the energy we deliver to our society and economy. We communicate with different stakeholders, decision makers, customers and other 9interested groups, including investors, employees and the public, about the access we provide to safe, reliable, and affordable energy.We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report which can be found at http://csr.enbridge.com. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Attract, Retain and Develop Highly Capable PeopleInvesting in the attraction, retention and development of employees and future leaders is fundamental to executing our growth strategy and creating sustainability for future success. We focus on enhancing the capability of our people to maximize the potential of our organization and undertake various activities such as accelerated leadership programs, rigorous succession planning of critical roles, and facilitating career development and mobility throughout the enterprise. We also value diversity and have embedded inclusive practices throughout our programs and approach to people management. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives to our employees.BUSINESS SEGMENTSOur activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution; Green Power and Transmission; and Energy Services, as discussed below.LIQUIDS PIPELINESLiquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and related terminals in Canada and the United States that transport various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons.1011MAINLINE SYSTEMThe mainline system is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/United States border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the United States/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined capacity of approximately 2.85 million barrels per day (bpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/United States border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the mainline system in the United States. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from Western Canada to the United States. Competitive Toll SettlementThe Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) is the current framework governing tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. The 10-year settlement was negotiated by representatives of Enbridge, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and shippers on the Canadian Mainline. It was approved by the National Energy Board (NEB) on June 24, 2011 and took effect on July 1, 2011. The CTS provides for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, which is based on the 2011 Incentive Tolling Settlement toll, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada on the Canadian Mainline and delivered into the United States, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. These tolls are denominated in United States dollars. The IJT is designed to provide shippers on the mainline system with a stable and competitive long-term toll, thereby preserving and enhancing throughput on both the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The CLT and the IJT were both established at the time of implementation of the CTS and are adjusted annually, on July 1 of each year, at a rate equal to 75% of the Canadian Gross Domestic Product at Market Price Index published by Statistics Canada.Although the CTS has a 10-year term, it does not require shippers to commit to certain volumes. Shippers nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Canadian Mainline. Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by the CTS and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under the terms of the IJT agreement, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the IJT relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the United States border is equal to the IJT applicable to that batch’s United States delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. This amount is referred to as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll and is denominated in United States dollars. 12Lakehead System Local TollsTransportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/United States border near Neche, North Dakota and from Clearbrook, Minnesota to certain principal delivery points. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing index rates, and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1.REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEM The Regional Oil Sands System includes five intra-Alberta long haul pipelines, the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which provide access for oil sands production to the system, and a long-haul intra-Alberta pipeline that transports diluent from the Edmonton, Alberta region into the oil sands producing regions located north and south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System currently serves twelve producing oil sands projects. The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long haul pipelines is approximately 930,000 bpd to Edmonton and 1,370,000 bpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218,000 bpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. The Woodland Pipeline and Norlite Pipeline System are joint ventures, 50/50 between us and Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Properties, and 70/30 with Keyera Corp. respectively. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system.GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENTGulf Coast includes Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South) and Spearhead Pipeline, as well as the Mid-Continent System comprised of the Cushing Terminal. Seaway PipelineIn 2011, we acquired a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast. The flow direction of Seaway Pipeline was reversed in 2012, enabling it to transport crude from the oversupplied hub in Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. Further pump station additions and modifications were completed in early 2013, increasing capacity available to shippers from an initial 150,000 bpd to approximately 400,000 bpd, depending on crude slate. In late 2014, a second line, the Seaway Pipeline Twin, was placed into service to more than double the existing capacity to 850,000 bpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes a 161-kilometer (100-mile) pipeline from the Enterprise Crude Houston crude oil terminal in Houston, Texas to the Port Arthur/Beaumont, Texas refining center. Flanagan South PipelineFlanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South and associated pumping stations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Flanagan South has an initial design capacity of approximately 600,000 bpd.13Spearhead PipelineSpearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline was originally placed into service in 2006 and has a capacity of 193,000 bpd.Mid-Continent System The Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma (Cushing Terminal), consisting of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78,000 to 570,000 barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder is contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, and blending fees.SOUTHERN LIGHTS PIPELINESouthern Lights Pipeline is a single stream pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. This 180,000 bpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline was placed into service in 2010. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights Canada) and the United States portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights US) receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity (18,000 bpd) assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes. EXPRESS-PLATTE SYSTEMThe Express-Platte system is comprised of both the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) crude oil transportation system, which begins in Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates in Wood River, Illinois. The Express pipeline carries crude oil to United States refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline in Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the Midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.BAKKEN SYSTEMThe Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken in North Dakota, and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The interstate portion of the system has both U.S. and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba.Tariffs on the United States portion of the North Dakota System are governed by the FERC and include a local tariff. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the NEB on a complaint basis. Tolls on the interstate pipeline system are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.In February 2017, we closed a transaction to acquire an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the United States Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the Dakota Access Pipeline from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka, 14Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Initial capacity is in excess of 500,000 bpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.FEEDER PIPELINES AND OTHERFeeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the United States. Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates out of Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. On July 1, 2014, Marathon executed an agreement with us to become an owner (35%) in SAX, thereby forming the Illinois Extension Pipeline Company (IEPC). We have a 65% ownership in IEPC. SAX was placed into service in December 2015 with the majority of its capacity commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480,000 barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost of service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.COMPETITIONOther competing carriers available to ship western Canadian liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the United States and internationally represent competition to our liquids pipelines network. Competition amongst existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets. Competition also arises from proposed pipelines that seek to access markets currently served by our liquids pipelines, such as proposed projects to the Gulf Coast and from proposed projects enhancing infrastructure in the Alberta regional oil sands market. The Mid-Continent and Bakken systems also face competition from existing pipelines, proposed future pipelines and existing and alternative gathering facilities. Competition for storage facilities in the United States includes large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently serviced by pipelines. We believe that our liquids pipelines continue to provide attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) and North Dakota due to our competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system are expected to provide shippers reliable and long-term competitive solutions for liquids transportation. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers and our existing right-of-way for the mainline system also provides a competitive advantage as it can be difficult and costly to obtain rights-of-way for new pipelines traversing new areas. SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the United States, the world’s largest market for crude oil. While United States demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by 15developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets. Higher prices in the early part of this decade encouraged production development which pushed supply beyond demand resulting in an extended price downturn starting in 2014. By the second half of 2016, drilling technology efficiencies and innovations in North America reinvigorated production growth. Oil prices continued to strengthen into 2018 on supply concerns created by sanctions being imposed on Iran; prompting Saudi Arabia and Russia to abandon rationing targets therefore reducing earlier price gains. At the same time, global demand softened in the wake of an escalating United States-China trade dispute. This resulted in the return to crude inventory builds globally. In Western Canada, lack of export pipeline capacity resulted in the rapid buildup of inventories and extreme discounts of Western Canadian crude; WCS discounts peaked at over US$50 per barrel against WTI in October. This, in turn, resulted in the Alberta Government entering into negotiations to purchase 7,000 rail cars and 80 engines to add about 120,000 bpd of rail export capacity for the industry by the end of 2020, and the adoption of a production curtailment policy directing the industry in the province to shut in 325,000 bpd starting January 1, 2019. The aim of this policy is to both draw down inventories by approximately 20 million barrels and return crude discounts to more historical norms. The policy calls for curtailment levels to be reduced as inventory levels ratchet down and new pipeline and rail capacity come on line. Western Canadian crude prices responded almost immediately upon the release of the curtailment adoption notice, with discounts narrowing to around US$10 per barrel. The discount at this level would imply that rail is not financially attractive, and hence frustrating the government's efforts to draw down inventories. Notwithstanding the current price environment and Alberta policies, our mainline system has thus far continued to be highly utilized. Mainline throughput as measured at the Canada/United States border at Gretna, Manitoba saw record deliveries of 2.8 million bpd in November 2018. The mainline system continues to be subject to apportionment, as nominated volumes currently exceed capacity on portions of the system. The impact of a low crude oil price environment on the financial performance of our liquids pipelines business is expected to be relatively modest given the cost effectiveness of our mainline toll, and commercial arrangements which underpin many of the pipelines providing a significant measure of protection against volume fluctuations. Our mainline system is well positioned to continue to provide safe and efficient transportation which will enable western Canadian and Bakken production to reach attractive markets in the United States and eastern Canada at a competitive cost relative to other alternatives. The fundamentals of oil sands production and steep discounts for Western Canadian crude have caused some sponsors to reconsider the timing of future projects. While recently updated forecasts continue to reflect long-term supply growth from the WCSB, the projected pace of growth is slower than previous forecasts as companies continue to assess the viability of capital investments in light of the current price environment and ongoing uncertainty with respect to the timing and completion of new pipeline systems proposed by our competitors. Over the long term, continued growth in global energy consumption is expected to be primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), mainly in India and China. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to moderate due to vehicle fuel efficiencies and increasing sales of electric vehicles. Accordingly, there is a strategic opportunity to establish tide-water export facilities to service North American producers wanting access to global markets. Global crude oil production is expected to continue to grow through 2035, primarily by North America, Brazil and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Growth in supply from OPEC is partly due to the expected recovery of Iraqi and Libyan production. Over the longer term, North American production from tight oil plays is expected to grow as technology continues to improve well productivity and efficiencies. The pace of growth in North America and level of investment in the WCSB could be 16tempered in future years by a number of factors including a sustained period of low crude oil prices and corresponding production decisions by OPEC, increasing environmental regulation, and prolonged approval processes for new pipelines with access to tide-water for export or to United States markets. In recent years, the combination of relatively flat domestic demand, growing supply and long-lead time to build pipeline infrastructure led to a fundamental change in the North American crude oil landscape. The inability to move increasing inland supply to markets resulted in a divergence between WTI and world pricing, resulting in lower netbacks for North American producers. The impact of price differentials has been even more pronounced for western Canadian producers as insufficient pipeline infrastructure resulted in a further discounting of Alberta crude relative to WTI. New pipeline capacity is expected to come online in 2019, further stabilizing differentials in western Canada and the end to the government curtailment program. Canadian pipeline export capacity is expected to remain fully utilized, resulting in continued apportionment on our mainline system and incremental production utilizing non-pipeline transportation services (e.g. rail and trucks) until such time as sufficient pipeline capacity is made available. Over the longer term, however, we believe pipelines will continue to be the most reliable and cost-effective means of transportation. Our role in helping to address the evolving supply and demand fundamentals and alleviating price discounts for producers and supply costs to refiners is through optimization of throughput on our existing liquids pipelines systems and through investment in new pipelines and related infrastructure to provide expanded transportation capacity and sustainable connectivity to alternative markets. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7.

COMPETITIONOur natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The flow pattern of natural gas is changing across North America due to emerging supply sources and evolving demand centers, which 21creates competition for growth opportunities. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.Competition exists in all of the markets our businesses serve. Competitors include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies.SUPPLY AND DEMAND Our gas transmission assets make up one of the largest natural gas transportation networks in North America, driving connectivity between prolific supply basins and major demand centers within the continent. Our systems have been integral to the transition in natural gas fundamentals over the last decade, and will continue to play a part as the energy landscape evolves. Shifts in production and consumption, both domestic and foreign, will require that we continue to serve as a critical link between markets.At the close of the last decade, natural gas production in each of the Appalachian and Permian basins was less than 5.0 bcf/d each. Today, these regions produce more than 40.0 bcf/d of natural gas on a combined basis. Improved technology and increased shale gas drilling has increased the supply of low cost natural gas. As well, there has been and continues to be a corresponding increase in demand for our natural gas infrastructure in North America. Through a series of expansions and reversals on our core systems, combined with the execution of greenfield projects and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to meet the needs of producers and consumers alike. Our United States Gas Transmission systems were initially designed to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast to the supply starved northeast markets. Our asset base now has the capability to transport diverse supply to the northeast, southeast, midwest, and gulf coast markets on a fully subscribed and highly utilized basis.The northeast market continues its role as a predominantly supply constrained region with steady growth. Natural gas demand in the northeast is expected to grow by 3.1 bcf/d through 2035, driven by continued commercial and residential load growth. Natural gas leads the fuel mix of the Independent System Operator New England market at more than 40 percent. The bidirectional capabilities offered by our system allow us to deliver both domestic and imported supplies to our regional customers, 75 percent of whom are local distribution companies with a contract renewal rate of 98 percent. The region has seen an increase in natural gas supply due to the development of the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachia region.Demand for natural gas in the southeast region is forecast to increase by 3.5 bcf/d through 2035. Generating capacity in Florida is expected to grow 15 percent by 2026, the majority of which is projected to be natural gas-fired. The Southeast market is linked to multiple, highly liquid supply pools that include the Marcellus and Utica shale developments, offering consistent supply and stable pricing to a growing population of end-use customers across our multiple systems under long term, utility-like arrangements.With connectivity to Appalachian and western Canadian supply through our systems, the midwest market has access to two of the lowest cost gas producing regions on the continent. As demand in the region continues to grow by approximately 3.0 bcf/d over the next two decades, maintaining this link will remain important. Flexibility in supply for this market is especially critical to maintaining liquidity and price stability as natural gas continues to replace coal fired generation.22Gulf coast demand growth is being driven by an ongoing wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities which are now starting to enter service, along with power generation, an increase in the volume of LNG exports and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Demand in the region is anticipated to grow by more than 6.0 bcf/d through 2035. The Gulf coast market has been the beneficiary of low cost capacity on our assets as the relationship between supply and market centers has shifted. Such cost effective capacity is difficult to access or replicate, offering existing shippers and transporters stability of capacity and utilization. Tide water market access and proximity to Mexico continue to make this region a platform of global trade as pipeline, LNG and LPG exports see strong growth. The United States exported approximately 3.0 bcf/d of natural gas from the gulf coast region at the end of 2018 with an export capacity of approximately 10.0 bcf/d scheduled to be in service by 2021.Despite there being strong growth in both supply and demand in the United States, a lack of adequate transportation capacity has placed downward pressure on local natural gas pricing. The Appalachian Basin has seen price differentials of $1.00 to $2.00 per MMBtu relative to Henry Hub in the gulf coast over the last few years. As 3.0 bcf/d of new capacity out of the region came online in late 2018, half of which is on our newly constructed assets, the differential between northeast production and downstream markets has significantly strengthened. Unlike the dry gas production of the Marcellus, natural gas production growth in the Permian Basin is a result of robust crude oil production taking place in the region. Associated gas supplies from the region increased by approximately 4.0 bcf/d over the past two years and growth is forecasted to continue for the next decade. Until new natural gas transportation capacity begins to come online in the second half of 2019, the natural gas prices in the region will continue to remain low relative to other producing regions.Western Canada is experiencing a similar phenomenon to that of the Permian, with the local markets experiencing very low or even negative prices for natural gas, as transportation bottlenecks continue. One of the few vital links to demand centers in the pacific northwest are our own systems in the region which operate near full capacity. As demand for supply out of the WCSB continues to grow, driven largely by NGL production and local oil sands production, the need for new natural gas and NGL infrastructure will continue to rise. Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 30 percent by 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. Natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand as gas consumption is anticipated to grow by approximately 45 percent during this period as one of the world’s fastest growing energy sources. North American exports will play a significant part in meeting global demand, underscoring the ability of our assets to remain highly utilized by shippers, and highlighting the need for incremental transportation solutions across North America. In response to these global fundamentals, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to shippers. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investments in Canadian and United States gas transportation facilities. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7.

This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Quebec and New Brunswick and an investment in Noverco Inc (Noverco).On August 30, 2018, we received a decision from the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) approving the application to amalgamate EGD and Union Gas (Amalgamation). On October 15, 2018, we announced that we would proceed with the Amalgamation, with an expected effective date of January 1, 2019. On 23January 1, 2019, the Amalgamation was completed and the amalgamated company continued as Enbridge Gas Inc. The OEB decision also approved the rate setting mechanism for the amalgamated entity to be employed during a five-year deferred rebasing period from 2019 through 2023, after which time rates will be rebased. The decision also approved the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts, as well as an earnings sharing mechanism that requires the amalgamated entity to share equally with customers, any earnings in excess of 150 basis points over the OEB approved return on equity (ROE).The Amalgamation, on January 1, 2019, created the single largest natural gas utility in North America in terms of send-out volumes, and third largest in terms of number of customers. We expect that this will drive efficiencies and synergies, leverage greater supply-chain strength, create new opportunities for growth, and form a stronger platform to deliver strong, predictable returns to shareholders and superior value and service to customers.Given the timing of the Amalgamation, this Annual Report on Form 10-K continues to provide separate descriptions of EGD and Union Gas and separate discussions of the operating and financial performance of each of those entities for the year ended December 31, 2018. Post-Amalgamation, the management and operations of EGD and Union Gas will become integrated and the operating and financial results of Enbridge Gas Inc. will reflect the combined performance of the two legacy utility operations.ENBRIDGE GAS DISTRIBUTIONEGD is a rate-regulated natural gas distribution utility serving approximately 2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in its franchise areas of central and eastern Ontario. In addition, EGD currently serves areas in northern New York State through St. Lawrence Gas Company Inc. (St. Lawrence Gas). In August 2017, EGD entered into an agreement to sell the issued and outstanding shares of St. Lawrence Gas. The transaction is expected to close in 2019, subject to regulatory approval and certain pre-closing conditions.EGD also owns and operates regulated and unregulated natural gas storage facilities in Ontario. The utility business is conducted under statutes and municipal bylaws which grant the right to operate in the areas served. The utility operations of EGD and St. Lawrence Gas are regulated by the OEB and by the New York State Public Service Commission, respectively.24As at December 31, 2018, EGD owned and operated a network of approximately 83,000-kilometers (51,574-miles) of mains for the distribution of natural gas, as well as the service pipes to transfer natural gas from mains to meters on customers' premises.There are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which EGD is directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage.Distribution EGD's principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis (without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract). The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts.TransportationEGD relies on its long-term contracts with Union Gas, an affiliated company under common control, for transportation of natural gas from Dawn. These contracts effectively provide EGD with access to United States sourced natural gas at Dawn. These contracts also provide transportation for natural gas received at Dawn via Vector as well as natural gas stored at EGD's and Union Gas' storage pools. Key pipeline interconnects enabled EGD to deliver approximately 449 bcf of gas through EGD's distribution and transmission system in 2018. In addition, EGD contracts for firm transportation service with TransCanada Corporation (TransCanada) to meet its annual natural gas supply requirements. The transportation service contracts are not directly linked with any particular source of natural gas supply. Separating transportation contracts from natural gas supply allows EGD flexibility in obtaining its customer's natural gas supply and accommodating the requests of its direct purchase customers for assignment of TransCanada capacity. EGD forecasts the natural gas supply needs of its customers, including the associated transportation and storage requirements.StorageEGD’s business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits EGD to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off‑peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice permits EGD to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing its overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to EGD's franchise area. EGD's principal storage facilities are located in southwestern Ontario, near Dawn, and have a total working capacity of approximately 109 bcf in 11 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. 99 petajoules (PJs) of the total working capacity is available to EGD for utility operations. EGD also has storage contracts with third parties for 6 bcf of storage capacity.UNION GASUnion Gas is a rate‑regulated natural gas distribution utility that currently serves approximately 1.5 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in its franchise areas of northern, southwestern and eastern Ontario.Union Gas' regulated and unregulated storage and transmission business offers storage and transmission services to customers at Dawn. It offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canada and United States supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeastern United States. The utility business is conducted under statutes and municipal by‑laws which grant the right to operate in the areas served. The utility operations of Union Gas are regulated by the OEB.25As at December 31, 2018, Union Gas owned and operated a network of approximately 67,000-kilometers (41,632-miles) of mains for the transportation and distribution of natural gas, as well as the service pipes to transfer natural gas from mains to meters on customers' premises.Similar to EGD, there are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which Union Gas is directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage.Distribution Union Gas’ principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis (without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract). The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are underpinned by firm or interruptible service contracts.Transportation Union Gas’ transmission system consists of approximately 5,000-kilometers (3,107-miles) of high-pressure pipeline and five mainline compressor stations. Key pipeline interconnects in Canada and the United States enabled Union Gas to deliver approximately 1,372 bcf of gas through Union Gas’ distribution and transmission system in 2018. Union Gas’ transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at Dawn to major Canadian and United States markets. There are multiple pipelines providing access to Dawn. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible transportation services on the Union Gas system. As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario continues to grow, there is an increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. As of November 1, 2017, the transmission system has an effective peak daily demand capacity of 7.5 bcf/d. A substantial amount of Union Gas’ transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately 11 years, with the longest remaining contract term being 15 years.StorageUnion Gas’ underground natural gas storage facilities have a working capacity of approximately 167 bcf in 25 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. 100 PJs of the total working capacity is available to Union Gas for utility operations. Union Gas also has storage contracts with third parties for 11 bcf of storage capacity. Union Gas’ storage pools give customers access to all Dawn storage capacity and deliverability. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. During 2018, Dawn provided storage, balancing, gas loans, transport, exchange and peaking services to over 195 counterparties.A substantial amount of Union Gas’ storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately four years, with the longest remaining contract term being 18 years.NOVERCONoverco is a holding company that owns approximately 71% of Energir LP (Energir), formerly known as Gaz Metro Limited Partnership, a natural gas distribution company operating in the province of Quebec with interests in subsidiary companies operating gas transmission, gas distribution and power distribution businesses in the Province of Quebec and the State of Vermont. Energir serves approximately 520,000 residential and industrial customers and is regulated by the Quebec Régie de l’énergie and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. Noverco also holds, directly and indirectly, an investment in our common shares. We own an equity interest in Noverco through ownership of 38.9% of its common shares and an investment in its preferred shares. OTHER GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE26Other Gas Distribution and Storage includes natural gas distribution utility operations in the Provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec.Enbridge Gas New Brunswick Inc. operates the natural gas distribution franchise in the Province of New Brunswick, has approximately 12,000 customers and is regulated by the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board (NBEUB). On December 4, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement for the sale of Enbridge Gas New Brunswick Inc. Closing of the transaction remains subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur in 2019. For further information, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset Monetization.We also wholly own Gazifère, a natural gas distribution company that serves approximately 40,000 customers in western Quebec, a market not served by Energir. Gazifère is regulated by the Quebec Régie de l’énergie.COMPETITONEGD and Union Gas’ distribution systems are regulated by the OEB and are subject to regulation in a number of areas, including rates. EGD and Union Gas are not generally subject to third-party competition within their distribution franchise area. EGD and Union Gas compete with other forms of energy available to their customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include weather, price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and other factors. SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe expect that demand for natural gas in North America will continue to see low annual growth over the long term with continued growth in peak day demands. Some modest growth driven by low natural gas prices is expected to continue given the significant price advantage relative to their alternate energy options, with specific interest coming from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas. EGD and Union Gas continue to focus on promoting conservation and energy efficiency by undertaking activities focused on reducing natural gas consumption through various demand side management programs offered across all markets.The storage and transportation marketplace continues to respond to changing natural gas supply dynamics including a robust supply environment. In recent years, the robust North American gas supply balance, due mainly to the development of shale gas volumes including the Alberta, British Columbia, Marcellus and Utica shale areas, has resulted in lower commodity prices and narrower seasonal price spreads. Unregulated storage values are primarily determined based on the difference in value between winter and summer natural gas prices. Storage values have been relatively stable to slightly rising as the North American natural gas supply and demand slowly returned to a more balanced position.GREEN POWER & TRANSMISSIONGreen Power and Transmission consists of investments in renewable energy assets and transmission facilities. Renewable energy assets consist of wind, solar, geothermal and waste heat recovery facilities and are located in Canada primarily in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Quebec and in the United States primarily in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia. Green Power and Transmission also includes offshore wind facilities in operation and under development located in Europe.2728Green Power and Transmission includes interests in more than 1,700 MW of net renewable power generation capacity. Of this amount, approximately 477 MW is generated by wind facilities located in Canada, approximately 912 MW is generated by wind facilities located in the United States, approximately 100 MW is derived from a 24.9% interest in the 400 MW Rampion Offshore Wind Project and approximately 155 MW is derived from a 25% interest in the Hohe See Offshore wind power project and its subsequent expansion, both currently under construction. The vast majority of the power produced from these wind facilities is sold under long-term power purchase agreements. Green Power and Transmission also includes three solar facilities located in Ontario and a solar facility located in Nevada, with 51 MW and 27 MW, respectively, of power generating capacity net of our partners’ interests. Green Power and Transmission also includes the Montana-Alberta Tie-Line, a 300 MW transmission line from Great Falls, Montana to Lethbridge, Alberta.On August 1, 2018, we closed the sale of a 49% interest in all of our Canadian renewable assets, a 49% interest in two United States renewable assets and 49% of our interest in the Hohe See Offshore wind power project and its subsequent expansion, both currently under construction in Germany (collectively, the Renewable Assets). We maintain a 51% interest in the Renewable Assets and will continue to manage, operate and provide administrative services for these assets. For further information, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset Monetization.COMPETITIONOur Green Power and Transmission assets operate in the North American and European power markets, which are subject to competition and the supply and demand balance for power in the provinces and states in which they operate. The vast majority of the revenue generated by currently operating assets is generated pursuant to long term power purchase agreements or has been substantially hedged. As such, the financial performance of these assets is not significantly impacted by fluctuating power prices arising from supply/demand imbalances or the actions of competing facilities during the term of the applicable contracts. However, the renewable energy market sector includes large utilities and small independent power producers, which are expected to aggressively compete for new project development opportunities and for the right to supply customers when contracts roll off.SUPPLY AND DEMANDThe power generation and transmission network in North America is expected to undergo significant growth over the next 20 years. On the demand side, North American economic growth over the longer term is expected to drive growing electricity demand, although continued efficiency gains are expected to make the economy less energy-intensive and temper demand growth. On the supply side, legislation in Canada is expected to accelerate the retirement of aging coal-fired generation plants, resulting in a requirement for significant new generation capacity. While coal and nuclear facilities will continue to be core components of power generation in North America, gas-fired and renewable energy facilities, including biomass, hydro, solar and wind, are expected to be the preferred sources to replace coal-fired generation due to their lower carbon intensities. In the United States, there is over 85 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind power capacity and in Canada over 12 GW of installed wind power capacity. Solar resources in southwestern states such as Arizona, California and Nevada are considered to be some of the best in the world for large-scale solar plants and the United States currently has over 35 GW of installed solar photovoltaic capacity. The United States passed legislation extending the availability of certain federal tax incentives which have supported the profitability of wind and solar projects. However, expanding renewable energy infrastructure in North America is not without challenges. Growing renewable generation capacity is expected to necessitate substantial capital investment to upgrade existing transmission systems or, in many cases, build new transmission lines, as these high quality wind and solar resources are often found in regions that are not 29in close proximity to markets. In the near-term, uncertainty over the availability of tax or other government incentives in various jurisdictions, the ability to secure long-term power purchase agreements through government or investor-owned power authorities and low market prices of electricity may hinder the pace of future new renewable capacity development. However, continued improvement in technology and manufacturing capacity in the past few years has reduced capital costs and improved yield factors associated with renewable energy generation. These positive developments are expected to render renewable energy more competitive and support ongoing investment over the long term. In Europe, the future outlook for renewable energy, especially from offshore wind in countries with long coastlines and densely populated areas, is positive. According to the European Wind Energy Association, by 2030, wind energy capacity in Europe is expected to be 320 GW, including 66 GW of offshore capacity. There is also wide public support for carbon reduction targets and broader adoption of renewable generation across all governmental levels. Furthermore, governments in Europe are seeking to rationalize the contribution of nuclear power to the overall energy mix, which has resulted in an increased focus on alternative sources such as large scale offshore wind and is expected to create further investment opportunities.ENERGY SERVICESThe Energy Services businesses in Canada and the United States undertake physical commodity marketing activity and logistical services, and manage our volume commitments on various pipeline systems. Energy Services provides energy marketing services to North American refiners, producers and other customers.Through wholly-owned marketing subsidiaries, Energy Services provides crude oil, natural gas, NGL and power marketing services. Energy Services transact at many North American market hubs and provide our customers with various services, including transportation, storage, supply management and product exchanges. Our Energy Services subsidiaries are primarily physical commodity marketing companies focused on servicing customers across the value chain and capturing value from quality, time and location price differentials when opportunities arise. To execute these strategies, Energy Services transports and stores on both Enbridge-owned and third party assets using a combination of contracted long-term and short-term pipeline, storage tank, rail car and truck capacity agreements. COMPETITIONEnergy Services earnings are primarily generated from arbitrage opportunities which, by their nature, can be replicated by competitors. An increase in market participants entering into similar arbitrage strategies could have an impact on our earnings. Efforts to mitigate competition risk include diversification of the marketing business by transacting at the majority of major hubs in North America and establishing long-term relationships with clients and pipelines.ELIMINATIONS AND OTHEREliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs and the impact of foreign exchange hedge settlements, which are not allocated to business segments. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and corporate investments.OPERATIONAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC REGULATIONLIQUIDS PIPELINESOperational Regulation30We are subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs. In the United States, our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines. These laws and regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. The regulations determine the pressures at which our pipelines can operate.PHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. Additionally, PHMSA has established standards for storage facilities. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failure or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.In Canada, our pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations overseen by the NEB or provincial regulators. Applicable legislation and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. Among other obligations, this regulatory framework imposes requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. As in the United States, several legislative changes addressing pipeline safety in Canada have recently been enacted. The changes evidence an increased focus on the implementation of management systems to address key areas such as emergency management, integrity management, safety, security and environmental protection. Other legislative changes have created authority for the NEB to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance with the regulatory regime it administers, as well as to impose financial requirements for future abandonment and major pipeline releases. Environmental RegulationWe are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits and other approvals. In particular, in the United States, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs is likely to cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance. Some states in which we operate are implementing new emissions limits to comply with 2008 ozone standards regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, the ozone standards were lowered even further from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb, which may require states to implement additional emissions regulations. The precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes. In addition, compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs may significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels.In the United States, climate change action is evolving at state, regional and federal levels. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2007 established that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to federal 31regulations, we are currently subject to an obligation to report our GHG emissions at our largest emitting facilities, but are not generally subject to limits on emissions of GHGs. In addition, a number of states have joined regional GHG initiatives, and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in GHG emissions. Public interest groups and regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on the emission of methane associated with natural gas development and transmission as a source of GHG emissions. However, as the key details of future GHG restrictions and compliance mechanisms remain undefined, the likely future effects on our business are highly uncertain. For its part, Canada has reaffirmed its strong preference for a harmonized approach with that of the United States. The Government of Canada has recently released the details of a federal system of carbon pricing starting in 2019. The pricing will apply to provinces and territories that are not in compliance with the federal requirements.Due to the speculative outlook regarding any United States federal and state policies, we cannot estimate the potential effect of proposed GHG policies on our future consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, such legislation or regulation could materially increase our operating costs, require material capital expenditures or create additional permitting, which could delay proposed construction projects. Economic RegulationOur liquids pipelines also face economic regulation risk. Broadly defined, economic regulation risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies change or reject proposed or existing commercial arrangements including permits and regulatory approvals for new projects. The Canadian Mainline, Lakehead System and other liquids pipelines are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the NEB and FERC, with respect to the tariffs and tolls of those operations. The changing or rejecting of commercial arrangements, including decisions by regulators on the applicable tariff structure or changes in interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. Delays in regulatory approvals on projects such as our L3R Program, could result in cost escalations and construction delays, which also negatively impact our operations. GAS TRANSMISSION & MIDSTREAMOperational RegulationThe span of regulation risks that apply to the Liquids Pipeline business as described above under Liquids Pipelines also applies to the Gas Transmission and Midstream business. Additionally, most of our United States gas transmission operations are regulated by the FERC. The FERC regulates natural gas transmission in United States interstate commerce including the establishment of rates for services. The FERC also regulates the construction of United States interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, including the extension, enlargement and abandonment of facilities. In addition, certain operations are subject to oversight by state regulatory commissions. To the extent that the natural gas intrastate pipelines that transport or store natural gas in interstate commerce provide services under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, they are subject to FERC regulations. The FERC may propose and implement new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas transmission and storage companies, which remain subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect certain transmission of gas by intrastate pipelines.Our operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal, state and local environmental agencies. Our United States interstate natural gas pipelines and certain of DCP Midstream’s gathering and transmission pipelines are also subject to the regulations of the DOT concerning pipeline safety.The intrastate natural gas and NGL pipelines owned by us and DCP Midstream are subject to state regulation. The natural gas gathering and processing activities of DCP Midstream are not subject to FERC regulation.32Our Canadian operations are governed by various federal and provincial agencies with respect to pipeline safety, including the NEB, the Transportation Safety Board and the Ontario Technical Standards and Safety Authority.Our Canadian natural gas transmission and distribution operations and approximately two-thirds of the storage operations in Canada are subject to regulation by the NEB or the provincial agencies in Canada, such as the OEB. These agencies have jurisdiction similar to the FERC for regulating rates, the terms and conditions of service, the construction of additional facilities and acquisitions. Our British Columbia Pipeline currently has a two year Settlement Agreement with its Shippers that provides for cost sharing on certain controllable expenses and sets out the regulated ROE for the two year period. The Settlement Agreement has been approved by the NEB. Our British Columbia Field Services business in western Canada is regulated by the NEB pursuant to a framework for light-handed regulation under which the NEB acts on a complaints-basis for rates associated with that business.GAS DISTRIBUTIONOperational RegulationOur gas distribution utility operations are regulated by the OEB, the Quebec Régie de l’énergie and the NBEUB, among others. Regulators’ future actions may differ from current expectations, or future legislative changes may impact the regulatory environments in which we operate. To the extent that the regulators’ future actions are different from current expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or refund of amounts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or that would have been recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in absence of the effects of regulation, could be different from the amounts that are eventually recovered or refunded.We seek to mitigate operational regulation risk. We retain dedicated professional staff and maintain strong relationships with customers, intervenors and regulators. This strong regulatory relationship continued in 2018 with the OEB’s decision to approve of the application to amalgamate EGD and Union Gas in accordance with the OEB's guidance for Mergers, Acquisitions, Amalgamations and Divestitures. The decision approved a rate setting mechanism, effective January 1, 2019, to be employed during a five-year deferred rebasing period from 2019 through 2023, and allows us the opportunity to drive efficiencies and synergies.Enbridge Gas DistributionEGD’s distribution rates, beginning in 2014 through 2018, were set under a five-year customized incentive regulation (IR) plan. The plan required EGD to update select items each year beginning in 2015 and through 2018, in order to establish final allowed revenues and rates. Under the customized IR plan, EGD shared equally with customers, earnings above the approved allowed ROE. EGD's after-tax ROE was 9.00% for 2018 and 8.78% for 2017.Union GasUnion Gas’ distribution rates, beginning in 2014 through 2018, were set under a five-year IR plan which established new rates at the beginning of each year through the use of a pricing formula, rather than through the examination of revenue and cost forecasts. The IR plan included an earnings sharing mechanism with customers that permitted Union Gas to fully retain the ROE from utility operations up to 9.93%, to retain 50% of any earnings between 9.93% and 10.93%, and to retain 10% of any earnings above 10.93%.Environmental RegulationOur workers, operations and facilities are subject to municipal, provincial and federal legislation which regulate the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers. Environmental legislation primarily includes regulation of discharges to air, land and water; management and disposal of hazardous waste; and the assessment and management of contaminated sites.33Gas distribution system operation, as with any industrial operation, has the potential risk of abnormal or emergency conditions, or other unplanned events that could result in spills or emissions in excess of permitted levels. These events could result in injuries to workers or the public, fines, orders or charges, adverse impacts to the environment in which we operate, and/or property damage. We could also incur future liability for environmental (soil and groundwater) contamination associated with past and present site activities.In addition to gas distribution system operation, we also operate small oil and brine production and storage facilities in southwestern Ontario. Environmental risk associated with these facilities is the potential for unplanned releases. In the event of a release, remediation of the affected area would be required. There would also be potential for fines, orders or charges under environmental legislation, and potential third-party liability claims by any affected land owners.The gas distribution system and our other operations must maintain a number of environmental approvals and permits from governmental authorities to operate. As a result, these assets and facilities are subject to periodic inspection. An Annual Written Summary Report is submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP), formerly the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change to demonstrate we are in good standing with our Environmental Compliance Approvals. Failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in operational interruptions, fines, and/or orders for additional pollution control technology or environmental mitigation. As environmental requirements and regulations become more stringent, the cost to maintain compliance and the time required to obtain approvals has increased.On July 3, 2018, the Government of Ontario issued Ontario Regulation 386/18 (the “Regulation”) which revoked the Cap and Trade program regulation and prohibits registered participants from purchasing, selling, trading or otherwise dealing with emission allowances or credits. On July 25, 2018, the Government of Ontario introduced Bill 4 to wind down the Cap and Trade program. On October 31, 2018, Bill 4, Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018 (the “Act”) received Royal Assent. This Act detailed the wind down of the Ontario Cap and Trade program, effectively expunging any compliance obligation associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, in October 2018, the federal government confirmed that Ontario will be subject to the federal government’s carbon pricing program (otherwise known as the Federal Carbon Pricing Backstop Program) (the Program). EGD and Union Gas are in the process of updating already filed rate applications for the Program, based on recent regulation updates, with the OEB. We anticipate that all costs associated with the Program, including implementation and ongoing sustainment, will be considered a pass-through cost. As with previous years, in 2018, the EGD and Union Gas each reported GHG emissions to the Ontario MECP, and a number of voluntary reporting programs. Emissions from Ontario combustion sources were verified in detail by a third party accredited verifier with no material discrepancies found. Additionally, operational emissions from venting, fugitive and natural gas distribution emissions were reported to the MECP starting in 2017 in accordance with O. Reg. 143/16 - Quantification, Reporting, and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation standard quantification methods ON.350 and ON.400, respectively. EGD and Union Gas utilize emissions data management processes and systems to help with the data capture and mandatory and voluntary reporting needs. Quantification methodologies and emission factors will continually be updated in the system as required. Each utility publicly reports its GHG emissions. Collectively, EGD and Union Gas continue to work with industry associations to refine quantification methodologies and emissions factors, as well as best management practices to minimize emissions.34EMPLOYEESWe had approximately 12,000 employees as at December 31, 2018, including approximately 8,500 employees in Canada and approximately 3,500 employees in the United States. Approximately 1,800 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us. Approximately 48% of those employees are covered under agreements that either have expired or will expire by December 31, 2019. We are currently in the process of collective bargaining with respect to the expired or expiring contracts. We have mature working relationships with our labor unions and the parties have traditionally committed themselves to the achievement of renewal agreements without a work stoppage.EXECUTIVES AND OTHER OFFICERSThe following table sets forth information regarding our executive and other officers.NameAgePositionAl Monaco59President & Chief Executive OfficerJohn K.

RISK FACTORSExecution of our capital projects subjects us to various regulatory, development, operational and market risks that may affect our financial results. Our ability to successfully execute the development of our organic growth projects is subject to various regulatory, development, operational and market risks, including: •the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits from governments and regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms and to maintain those issued approvals and permits and satisfy the terms and conditions imposed therein; •potential changes in federal, state, provincial and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that may prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; •impediments on our ability to acquire or renew rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms; •opposition to our projects by third parties, including special interest groups; •the availability of skilled labor, equipment and materials to complete projects; •the ability to construct projects within anticipated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials or labor, contractor or supplier non-performance, weather, geologic conditions or other factors beyond our control, that may be material; •general economic factors that affect the demand for our projects; and •the ability to raise financing for these capital projects. Any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated cost. Recent projects that have experienced delays include the U.S. L3R Program, Atlantic Bridge and the T-South Expansion. New projects may not achieve their expected investment return, which could affect our financial results, and hinder our ability to secure future projects. For additional discussion of specific proceedings that could affect our operations and financial results, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legal and Other Updates.Cyber-attacks or security breaches could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Our business is dependent upon information systems and other digital technologies for controlling our plants and pipelines, processing transactions and summarizing and reporting results of operations. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of information is critical to our operations. A security breach of our network or systems, or the network or systems of our third-party vendors, could result in improper operation of our assets, potentially including delays in the delivery or availability of our customers’ products, contamination or degradation of the products we transport, store or distribute, or releases of hydrocarbon products for which we could be held liable. Furthermore, we and our third-party vendors collect and store sensitive data in the ordinary course of our business, including personal identification information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders. We have a cyber-security controls framework in place which has been derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber-security Framework and International Organization for Standardization 27001 standards. We monitor our control effectiveness in an increasing threat landscape and continuously take action to improve our security posture. We have implemented a 7X24 security operations center to monitor, detect and investigate any anomalous activity in our network together with an incident response process that we test on a monthly basis. We conduct independent cyber-security audits and penetration tests on a regular basis to test that our preventative and detective controls are working as designed. Despite our security measures, our information systems, or those of our vendors, may become the target of cyber-attacks (including hacking, viruses or acts of terrorism) or security breaches (including employee error, malfeasance or other 38breaches), which could compromise our network or systems, or those of our vendors, and result in the release or loss of the information stored therein, misappropriation of assets, disruption to our operations or damage to our facilities. Our current insurance coverage programs do not contain specific coverage for cyber-attacks or security breaches. As a result of a cyber-attack or security breach, we could also be liable under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, subject to regulatory penalties, experience damage to our reputation or a loss of consumer confidence in our products and services, or incur additional costs for remediation and modification or enhancement of our information systems to prevent future occurrences, all of which could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Our operations involve safety risks to the public and to our workers and contractors. Several of our pipelines and distribution systems and related assets are operated in close proximity to populated areas and a major incident could result in injury to members of the public. In addition, given the natural hazards inherent in our operations, our workers and contractors are subject to personal safety risks. A public safety incident or an injury to our workers or contractors could result in reputational damage to us, material repair costs or increased costs of operating and insuring our assets. Changes in our reputation with stakeholders, special interest groups, political leadership, the media or other entities could have negative impacts on our business, operations or financial results. There could be negative impacts on our business, operations or financial results due to changes in our reputation with stakeholders, special interest groups (including non-governmental organizations), political leadership, the media or other entities. Public opinion may be influenced by certain media and special interest groups’ negative portrayal of the industry in which we operate as well as their opposition to development projects, such as the Bakken Pipeline System. Potential impacts of a negative public opinion may include: •loss of business; •loss of ability to secure growth opportunities; •delays in project execution; •legal action; •increased regulatory oversight or delays in regulatory approval; and •loss of ability to hire and retain top talent. We are also exposed to the risk of higher costs, delays or even project cancellations due to increasing pressure on governments and regulators by special interest groups. Recent judicial decisions have increased the ability of special interest groups to make claims and oppose projects in regulatory and legal forums. In addition to issues raised by groups focused on particular project impacts, we and others in the energy and pipeline businesses are facing opposition from organizations opposed to oil sands development and shipment of production from oil sands regions. Pipeline operations involve numerous risks that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Operation of complex pipeline systems, gathering, treating, storing and processing operations involves many risks, hazards and uncertainties. These events include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides or other similar events beyond our control. These types of catastrophic events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of our operations, any of which could also result in substantial losses for which insurance may not be sufficient or available and for which we may bear a part or all of the cost. We have experienced such events in the past, including in 2010 on Lines 6A and 6B of the Lakehead System, in October 2018 at the BC Pipeline 39T-South system and in January 2019 at the Texas Eastern pipeline, and cannot guarantee that we will not experience catastrophic events in the future. In addition, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties from regulators in connection with any such events. Environmental incidents could also lead to an increased cost of operating and insuring our assets, thereby negatively impacting earnings. An environmental incident could have lasting reputational impacts to us and could impact our ability to work with various stakeholders. For pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas, including residential communities, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering locations, the level of damage resulting from these catastrophic events could be greater. There are utilization risks in respect to our assets. In respect to our Liquids Pipeline assets, we are exposed to throughput risk under the CTS on the Canadian Mainline and under certain tolling agreements applicable to other Liquids Pipelines assets, such as the Lakehead System. A decrease in volumes transported can directly and adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Factors such as changing market fundamentals, capacity bottlenecks, operational incidents, regulatory restrictions, system maintenance and increased competition can all impact the utilization of our assets. Market fundamentals, such as commodity prices and price differentials, weather, gasoline price and consumption, alternative energy sources and global supply disruptions outside of our control can impact both the supply of and demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons transported on our pipelines. In respect to our Gas Transmission and Midstream assets, gas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of non-conventional shale gas supplies. The increase in natural gas supply has resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, wet gas areas with higher NGL content which depressed activity in dry fields. This, in turn, has contributed to a resulting oversupply of pipeline takeaway capacity in some areas, which can adversely affect our revenues and earnings. In respect to our Gas Distribution assets, customers are billed on a combination of both fixed charge and volumetric basis and our ability to collect their respective total revenue requirement (the cost of providing service, including a reasonable return to the utility) depends on achieving the forecast distribution volume established in the rate-making process. The probability of realizing such volume is contingent upon four key forecast variables: weather, economic conditions, pricing of competitive energy sources and growth in the number of customers. Weather is a significant driver of delivery volumes, given that a significant portion of our Gas Distribution customer base uses natural gas for space heating. Distribution volume may also be impacted by the increased adoption of energy efficient technologies, along with more efficient building construction, that continue to place downward pressure on consumption. In addition, conservation efforts by customers may further contribute to a decline in annual average consumption. Our Gas Distribution business has deferral accounts approved by the OEB that provide regulatory protection against the margin impacts associated with declining annual average consumption due to efficiencies and customers’ conservation efforts. Sales and transportation service to large volume commercial and industrial customers is more susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. As well, the pricing of competitive energy sources affects volume distributed to these sectors as some customers have the ability to switch to an alternate fuel. Even in those circumstances where we attain our respective total forecast distribution volume, our Gas Distribution business may not earn its expected ROE due to other forecast variables, such as the mix between the higher margin residential and commercial sectors and the lower margin industrial sector. Our Gas Distribution business remains at risk for the actual versus forecast large volume contract commercial and industrial volumes.In respect to our Green Power and Transmission assets, earnings from these assets are highly dependent on weather and atmospheric conditions as well as continued operational availability of these energy producing assets. While the expected energy yields for Green Power and Transmission projects are predicted using long-term historical data, wind and solar resources are subject to natural variation from year to year and from season to season. Any prolonged reduction in wind or solar resources at any 40of the Green Power and Transmission facilities could lead to decreased earnings and cash flows for us. Additionally, inefficiencies or interruptions of Green Power and Transmission facilities due to operational disturbances or outages resulting from weather conditions or other factors, could also impact earnings. Power produced from Green Power and Transmission assets is also often sold to a single counterparty under power purchase agreements or other long-term pricing arrangements. In this respect, the performance of the Green Power and Transmission assets is dependent on each counterparty performing its contractual obligations under the power purchase agreements or pricing arrangement applicable to it. Our transformation projects may fail to fully deliver anticipated results. We launched projects starting in 2016 to transform various processes, capabilities and reporting systems infrastructure to continuously improve effectiveness and efficiency across the organization and are subject to transformation project risk with respect to these projects. Such projects, some of which will continue into 2019 and 2020, including integration initiatives arising out of the Merger Transaction and the amalgamation of EGD and Union Gas, are subject to transformation project risk. Transformation project risk is the risk that modernization projects carried out by us and our subsidiaries do not fully deliver anticipated results due to insufficiently addressing the risks associated with project execution and change management. This could result in negative financial, operational and reputational impacts.A service interruption could have a significant impact on our operations, and negatively impact financial results, relationships with stakeholders and our reputation. A service interruption due to a major power disruption or curtailment of commodity supply could have a significant impact on our operations and negatively impact financial results, relationships with stakeholders and our reputation. Specifically, for Gas Distribution, any prolonged interruptions would ultimately impact gas distribution customers. Service interruptions that impact our crude oil and natural gas transportation services can negatively impact shippers’ operations and earnings as they are dependent on our services to move their product to market or fulfill their own contractual arrangements. Our assets vary in age and were constructed over many decades which may cause our inspection, maintenance or repair costs to increase in the future. Our pipelines vary in age and were constructed over many decades. Pipelines are generally long-lived assets, and pipeline construction and coating techniques have changed over time. Depending on the era of construction, some assets require more frequent inspections, which could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures in the future. Any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. An impairment of our assets, including goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments, could reduce our earnings. GAAP requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. The outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our goodwill, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments. Additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if such assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings. We rely on access to short-term and long-term capital markets to finance capital requirements and support liquidity needs, and cost effective access to those markets can be affected, particularly if we or our rated subsidiaries are unable to maintain an investment-grade credit rating.41A significant portion of our consolidated asset base is financed with debt. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from assets. Accordingly, we rely on access to both short-term and long-term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt. Our senior unsecured long-term debt is currently rated investment-grade by various rating agencies. If the rating agencies were to rate us or our rated subsidiaries below investment-grade, our borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. Consequently, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease.We maintain revolving credit facilities to provide back-up for commercial paper programs for borrowings and/or letters of credit at various entities. These facilities typically include financial covenants and failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude that entity from issuing commercial paper or letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving credit facility, which could affect cash flows or restrict business. Furthermore, if our short-term debt rating were to be downgraded, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited. Although this would not affect our ability to draw under our credit facilities, borrowing costs could be significantly higher.If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates, our ability to finance operations and implement our strategy may be affected. Restrictions on our ability to access financial markets may also affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for future growth. Any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of our subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited, which in turn could increase our need to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries, thus reducing the liquidity and borrowing availability of the consolidated group.Our forecasted assumptions may not materialize as expected on our expansion projects, acquisitions and divestitures. We evaluate expansion projects, acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis. Planning and investment analysis is highly dependent on accurate forecasting assumptions and to the extent that these assumptions do not materialize, financial performance may be lower or more volatile than expected. Volatility and unpredictability in the economy, both locally and globally, change in cost estimates, project scoping and risk assessment could result in a loss in our profits. We may not be able to sell assets or, if we are able to sell assets, to raise an optimal amount of capital from such asset sales. In addition, the timing to close asset sales could be significantly different than our expected timeline.We have monetized or are in the process of monetizing certain assets to execute on our strategic priority to focus on core assets and to accelerate debt reduction and provide capital. Of the $7.8 billion in announced assets sales, $5.7 billion have closed. The remaining $2.1 billion is still subject to regulatory approvals and other factors. If we are able to sell assets, the timing of the receipt of the asset sale proceeds may not align with the timing of our capital requirements. A failure to close remaining sales or a misalignment of the timing of capital raised and capital funding needs could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Our operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations and affect or limit our business plans. 42Many of our operations are regulated. The nature and degree of regulation and legislation affecting energy companies in Canada and the United States have changed significantly in past years and further substantial changes may occur.On February 8, 2018, the Government of Canada introduced legislation to revise the process for assessing major resource projects. If the legislation is passed in its current form, we believe it would have adverse impacts on pipeline companies, particularly in relation to the regulatory review process for proposed new projects that are “designated projects”, by making overall timelines for the development and execution of these projects longer and significantly increasing uncertainty. Compliance with legislative changes may impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in a number of consequences which may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition and cash flows. Our operations are subject to operational regulation and failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Operational regulation risks relate to compliance with applicable operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs. Regulatory scrutiny over the integrity of our assets and operations has the potential to increase operating costs or limit future projects. Potential regulatory changes could have an impact on our future earnings and the cost related to the construction of new projects. Regulators' future actions may differ from current expectations, or future legislative changes may impact the regulatory environments in which we operate. We seek to mitigate operational regulation risk by active monitoring and consulting on potential regulatory requirement changes with the respective regulators directly, or through industry associations. We also develop robust response plans to regulatory changes or enforcement actions. While we believe the safe and reliable operation of our assets and adherence to existing regulations is the best approach to managing operational regulatory risk, the potential remains for regulators to make unilateral decisions that could have a financial impact on us.Our operations are subject to economic regulation and failure to secure regulatory approval for our proposed or existing project could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our liquids pipelines face economic regulatory risk, the risk that governments or regulatory agencies change or reject proposed or existing commercial arrangements including permits and regulatory approvals for new projects. We believe that economic regulatory risk is reduced through the negotiation of long-term agreements with shippers that govern the majority of our liquids pipeline assets. We also involve our legal and regulatory teams in the review of new projects to ensure compliance with applicable regulations as well as in the establishment of tariffs and tolls on new and existing pipelines. However, despite our efforts to mitigate economic regulation risk, there remains a risk that a regulator could modify significantly its own long-standing policies for rate making as well as overturn long-term agreements that we have entered into with shippers or deny the approval and permits for new projects.Our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations and affect or limit our business plans, or expose us to environmental liabilities. We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. 43Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations and failure to secure permits necessary for our operations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting our operating assets. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations or the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations could result in a material increase in our cost of compliance with such laws and regulations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals and permits for our operating assets or development projects. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or permits, if we fail to obtain or comply with them, or if environmental laws or regulations change or are administered in a more stringent manner, the operations of facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented, delayed or become subject to additional costs. We expect that costs we incur to comply with environmental regulations in the future may have a significant effect on our earnings and cash flows. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses in the event of an accident, natural disaster or other hazardous event.Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in our industry. Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We maintain a comprehensive insurance program for us, our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates. This program includes insurance coverage in types and amounts and with terms and conditions that are generally consistent with coverage customary for our industry.Although we believe our current coverage is adequate for our purposes, we have in the past had occurrences that led to losses exceeding our then-applicable coverage limits, and there is no assurance that the same may not happen in the future. In the unlikely event that multiple insurable incidents which in aggregate exceed coverage limits occur within the same insurance period, the total insurance coverage will be allocated among our entities on an equitable basis based on an insurance allocation agreement among us and our subsidiaries.Competition may result in a reduction in demand for our services, fewer project opportunities or assumption of risk that results in weaker or more volatile financial performance than expected. We face competition from competing carriers available to ship western Canadian liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the United States and internationally and from proposed pipelines that seek to access markets currently served by our liquids pipelines. Competition among existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets. We also face competition from alternative gathering and storage facilities. Our natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, and renewable energy. Competition in all of our businesses, including competition for new project development opportunities, could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers.We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment-grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or provide us security to satisfy credit concerns. A significant amount of our credit exposures for transmission, storage, and gathering and processing services are with customers who have an investment-grade rating (or the equivalent based on our evaluation) or are secured by collateral. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in our customers’ creditworthiness. As a result of future capital projects for which natural gas and 44oil producers may be the primary customer, our credit exposure with below investment-grade customers may increase. It is possible that customer payment defaults, if significant, could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.Our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans. Our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, including engineers, technical personnel and other professionals. We and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce. If we are unable to retain current employees and/or recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, we could experience increased allocated costs to retain and recruit these professionals. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could adversely affect our financial results.We are subject to numerous legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. It is reasonably possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which we are involved could require additional expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could adversely affect our financial results. Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Legal and Other Updates for a discussion of legal proceedings.Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or acts of war, and other civil unrest or activism could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity or acts of war, or other civil unrest or activism may have significant effects on general economic conditions and may cause fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity, each of which could adversely affect our business. Future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States, or Canada, or military or trade disruptions may significantly affect our operations and those of our customers. Strategic targets, such as energy related assets, may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the United States and Canada. In addition, increased environmental activism against pipeline construction and operation could potentially result in work delays, reduced demand for our products and services, increased legislation or denial or delay of permits and rights-of-way. Finally, the disruption or a significant increase in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results. Our Liquids Pipelines growth rate and results may be indirectly affected by commodity prices and Government policy. Recent efforts by the Alberta Government to manage supply and inventories in Western Canada is expected to be short term in application and have negligible impact on mainline throughput, as enough inventory exists to meet refinery customer needs and service our favorable markets. Current oil sands production is very robust and is expected to grow in the future as producers actively improve the competitiveness of their existing projects. Sanctioned projects due to come on stream in the next 24 months, which may face delays under the Alberta curtailment program, are not as sensitive to short-term declines in crude oil prices, as investment commitments have already been made. Wide commodity price basis between Western Canada and global tidewater markets have negatively impacted producer netbacks and margins in the past years that largely resulted from pipeline infrastructure takeaway 45capacity from producing regions in Western Canada and North Dakota which are operating at capacity. A protracted long-term outlook for low crude oil prices could result in delay or cancellation of future projects.The tight oil plays of Western Canada and the Bakken region of North Dakota have short cycle break-even time horizons, typically less than 24 months, and high decline rates that can be well managed through active hedging programs and are positioned to react quickly at market signals. Accordingly, during periods of comparatively low prices, drilling programs, unsupported by hedging programs, will be reduced and as such supply growth from tight oil basins may be lower, which may impact volumes on our pipeline systems. Our Gas Transmission and Midstream results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities.Our exposure to commodity price volatility is inherent to part of our natural gas processing business. We employ a disciplined hedging program to manage this direct commodity price risk. Because we are not fully hedged, we may be adversely impacted by commodity price exposure on the commodities we receive in-kind as payment for our gathering, processing, treating and transportation services. As a result of our unhedged exposure and the pricing of our hedge positions, a substantial decline in the prices of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results.Additionally, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure, we likely will be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges. Our hedging activities can result in substantial losses if hedging arrangements are imperfect or ineffective and our hedging policies and procedures are not followed properly or do not work as intended. Further, hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the contracts, particularly during periods of weak and volatile economic conditions. In addition, certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. This causes periodic earnings volatility due to fluctuations in commodity prices.Our Energy Services results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility.Energy Services generates margin by capitalizing on quality, time and location differentials when opportunities arise. Volatility in commodity prices due to changing market conditions could limit margin opportunities and impede Energy Services' ability to cover capacity commitments. Furthermore, commodity prices could have negative earnings and cash flow impacts if the cost of the commodity is greater than resale prices achieved by us.Our risk management policies cannot eliminate all risks. In addition, any non-compliance with our risk management policies could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.We use derivative financial instruments to manage the risks associated with movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and our share price to reduce volatility to our cash flows. Based on our risk management policies, all of our derivative financial instruments are associated with an underlying asset, liability and/or forecasted transaction. We do not enter into transactions with the objective of speculating on commodity prices or interest rates. These policies cannot, however, eliminate all risk of unauthorized trading and other speculative activity.

USMCA/CUSMA has been signed but not ratified by the legislature of each of the United States, Canada and Mexico. NAFTA provides protection against tariffs, duties and other charges or fees and assures access by the signatories. The impact of USMCA/CUSMA, if ratified, on energy markets is uncertain. The effect of comprehensive United States tax reform legislation on us, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain.On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018” (informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). The effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on us, our subsidiaries and our shareholders, whether adverse or favorable, is still uncertain. While the United States Treasury issued substantial guidance in 2018 in the form of proposed regulations, uncertainty will still exist until the proposed regulations are finalized. ITEM 1B.

895728,ENB,ENBRIDGE INC,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Looking ahead, our near-term strategic priorities remain similar to years past. We remain focused on growing our three core business lines - Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, and Gas Distribution and Storage within a regulated pipeline and utility business model, while enhancing our competitive position by optimizing operations, maintaining a strong financial position and pursuing efficiencies through continuous process improvement and the application of technology solutions. As North American production of crude oil and natural gas is projected to exceed demand, we will continue to orient the development of our liquids and natural gas pipeline infrastructure toward export-driven opportunities that will further enhance the growth and resilience of our systems. Our renewable power generation business, anchored by investments in contracted offshore wind power, compliments our low risk business model and supports our increasing focus on energy transition. We will continue to invest in renewable power generation where we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns. Our key strategic priorities are summarized below:Commitment to Safety and Operational Reliability Safety and operational reliability remain the foundation of our strategy. Our commitment to safety and operational reliability means achieving and maintaining industry leadership in safety (process, public and personal) and ensuring the reliability and integrity of the systems we operate, in order to generate, transport and deliver energy while protecting people and the environment. 9Optimize Core Businesses A key priority is to drive growth through an ongoing focus on optimization, productivity and efficiency across all of our businesses. Examples include throughput enhancements on our liquids system from the application of drag-reducing agents and improvements in scheduling logistics at our terminals, revenue optimization through negotiated toll settlements or rate cases, ongoing synergy capture following our recent utility merger and, more generally, creating sustainable cost savings across the organization through process improvement and/or system enhancements. Execute and Extend Growth Successful project execution is integral to our financial performance and to the strategic positioning of our business over the long-term. Our ongoing objective is to deliver our slate of secured projects (currently $11 billion) at the lowest practical cost while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.In seeking to extend growth, we expect to have sufficient self-funding capacity, post completion of our secured capital program, to invest $5 to $6 billion per year in new growth capital without issuing any additional common equity and maintaining key credit metrics within planning parameters and targets established with credit rating agencies. Through 2040, we see strong utilization of our existing network and opportunities for future growth within each of our businesses. For example:•Our liquids pipelines infrastructure will remain a vital connection between key supply basins and demand-pull markets, while the growing North American export market represents an opportunity to further expand midstream offerings and services.•Our natural gas pipelines business plays an essential role in driving the North American economy, servicing markets totaling more than 170 million people. We expect natural gas to play an increasing role in power generation supporting the retirement of coal, while the growing Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) export sector will drive opportunities to expand our existing network.•Our gas distribution utility, serving the fifth largest population center in North America, is forecast to continue to provide customers with a significant cost advantage versus other fuels. In addition, technology is now being advanced and deployed to produce pipeline quality natural gas with a lower carbon footprint such as renewable natural gas.•We also have several offshore wind projects in the advanced development phase. Growth in offshore wind is accelerating due to public policy support and technology advancement in the renewable energy sector. New renewable assets with long-term contracts will contribute to our low-risk growth.•In all of our business segments, the replacement, renewal and modernization of our existing infrastructure is a further capital deployment opportunity. Maintain a Strong Financial Position The maintenance of our financial strength is critical to our strategy. Our financing strategies are designed to achieve strong, investment-grade credit ratings to ensure that we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions and respond to opportunities as they arise. Our current secured capital program, which extends beyond 2020, can be readily financed through internally generated cash flow and available balance sheet capacity without issuance of additional common equity and we will seek to drive attractive growth post 2020 using this “self-funded” equity model. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.10Disciplined Capital Allocation As we seek growth, we assess the latest fundamental trends, monitor the business landscape and proactively conduct business development activities with the goal of identifying an industry-leading opportunity set for capital deployment. Opportunities are screened, analyzed and assessed using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.All projects are evaluated based on their potential to advance our strategy, sustain growth and create additional financial flexibility. Our primary emphasis is on projects that optimize and extend our existing footprint and position us for sustained long-term growth. Execution risk remains high for large scale, long-duration development projects and therefore, our focus will be on projects where we can carefully manage at-risk capital during the permitting and construction phases. In evaluating typical investment opportunities we also consider other potential capital allocation choices that may add value. Other potential choices for capital deployment will depend on our current outlook and the size of our existing capital project backlog, and could include dividend increases, further debt reduction, a large scale acquisition or share re-purchases. Adapt to Energy Transition Over Time As the global population grows and standards of living continue to improve around the world, more energy will be needed. At the same time, our society increasingly recognizes the impacts of energy consumption on the world’s climate. Accordingly, energy systems are being reshaped as industry participants, regulators and consumers seek to balance competing objectives. As a diversified energy infrastructure company, we are well positioned to play a key role in the transition to a lower-carbon economy while working to reduce our own emissions intensity at the same time. We believe that diversification and innovation will play a significant role in the transition to a lower carbon future. To date, we have made large investments in natural gas infrastructure and continue to see significant opportunity in renewable energy, particularly offshore wind. Furthermore, we have tested our existing assets for various energy transition scenarios and concluded that they are highly resilient and can be relied upon for stable cash flow generation well into the future. STRATEGIC ENABLERSOur success in executing on our strategic priorities is very much enabled by our commitment to environment, social and governance (ESG) issues, the quality and capabilities of our people and the extent to which we embrace technology and encourage innovation as a competitive advantage.ESGOur everyday decision-making is informed by ESG issues, delivering the energy people need and want in a way that is environmentally, socially and economically responsible is critical to the long-term sustainability of our business. We’re focused on reducing the intensity of our own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations, helping customers reduce their energy use and GHG impact and investing in lower carbon solutions such as natural gas and renewable energy.We’re also focused on building and maintaining constructive relationships with local communities and other groups directly impacted by our activities over the life-cycle of our assets. Recognizing the distinct rights of Indigenous communities, we have dedicated accountabilities and resources focused on consultation and inclusion. Broadly, our goal is to build awareness and balanced dialogue on the role and value of the energy we deliver to our society and economy.11PeopleOur employees are essential to our long-term success and enhancing the capability of our people to maximize their potential is a key area of focus. We value diversity and have embedded inclusive practices throughout our programs and approach to people management. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives.TechnologyGiven the competitive climate of today’s energy sector, we recognize the vital role technology can play in helping us achieve our strategic objectives. Our two Technology and Innovation labs, located in Calgary and Houston, embody our commitment to technology-driven business solutions. Leveraging the benefits of technology to contribute to safety, reliability and the profitability of assets has become entrenched in our everyday operations.We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report which can be found at http://csr.enbridge.com. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.BUSINESS SEGMENTSOur activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution and Storage; Renewable Power Generation; and Energy Services, as discussed below.During 2019, we renamed the Gas Distribution segment to Gas Distribution and Storage, and the Green Power and Transmission segment to Renewable Power Generation. The presentation of the prior years' tables have been revised in order to align with the current presentation.12LIQUIDS PIPELINESLiquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and related terminals in Canada and the United States that transport various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons.13MAINLINE SYSTEMThe Mainline System is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/United States border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the United States/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined capacity of approximately 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/United States border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the Mainline System in the United States. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by FERC, and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from western Canada to the United States.Competitive Toll SettlementThe Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) is the current framework governing tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. The 10-year settlement was negotiated by representatives of Enbridge, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and other shippers on the Canadian Mainline. It was approved by the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), formerly the National Energy Board on June 24, 2011 and took effect on July 1, 2011. The CTS provides for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada, on the Canadian Mainline, and delivered into the United States, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. The IJT tolls are denominated in United States dollars. The IJT is designed to provide shippers on the Mainline System with a stable and competitive long-term toll, thereby preserving and enhancing throughput on both the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The CLT and the IJT are adjusted annually, on July 1 of each year, at a rate equal to 75% of the Canadian Gross Domestic Product at Market Price Index published by Statistics Canada.Although the CTS has a 10-year term, it does not require shippers to commit to certain volumes. Shippers nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Canadian Mainline.Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by the CTS and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under the terms of the IJT agreement, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the IJT relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the United States border is equal to the IJT applicable to that batch’s United States delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. This amount is referred to as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll and is denominated in United States dollars.Lakehead System Local TollsTransportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/United States border near Neche, North Dakota, Clearbrook, Minnesota and other points to principal delivery points on the Lakehead System. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing index rates, and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1 of each year.14Mainline System Contracting On December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the CER to implement contracting on our Mainline System. The application for contracted and uncommitted service included the associated terms, conditions and tolls of each service, which would be offered in an open season following approval by the CER. The tolls and services would replace the current CTS that is in place until June 30, 2021. If a replacement agreement is not in place by that time, the CTS tolls will continue on an interim basis.For further information, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments - Mainline System Contracting. REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEMThe Regional Oil Sands System includes five intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines; the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which provide access for oil sands production to the system. The Regional Oil Sands System currently serves twelve producing oil sands projects.The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines is approximately 930,000 bpd to Edmonton and 1,370,000 bpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218,000 bpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. The Woodland Pipeline and Norlite are joint ventures, 50/50 between us and Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Properties, and 70/30 with Keyera Corp., respectively. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system.GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENTGulf Coast includes Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South), Spearhead Pipeline and Gray Oak Pipeline, as well as the Mid-Continent System comprised of the Cushing Terminal.Seaway PipelineWe have a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast.The flow direction of Seaway Pipeline was reversed in 2012, enabling it to transport crude from the oversupplied hub in Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. Further pump station additions and modifications were completed in early 2013, increasing capacity available to shippers from an initial 150,000 bpd to approximately 400,000 bpd, depending on crude slate. In late 2014, a second line, the Seaway Pipeline Twin, was placed into service to more than double the existing capacity to 950,000 bpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes a 161-kilometer (100-mile) pipeline from the Enterprise Crude Houston crude oil terminal in Houston, Texas to the Port Arthur/Beaumont, Texas refining center.Flanagan SouthFlanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South and associated pumping stations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Flanagan South has a capacity of approximately 600,000 bpd.15Spearhead PipelineSpearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline was originally placed into service in 2006 and has a capacity of approximately 193,000 bpd.Gray Oak PipelineThe Gray Oak pipeline is a 1,368-kilometer (850-mile) crude oil system, which runs from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the United States gulf coast. The Gray Oak pipeline has an expected average annual capacity of 900,000 bpd and transports light crude oil. We have an effective 22.8% interest in the pipeline. Initial in-service for the pipeline commenced in November 2019 with full in-service expected in the second quarter of 2020.Mid-Continent SystemThe Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma (Cushing Terminal), consisting of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78,000 to 570,000 barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder are contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, as well as blending fees.OTHEROther includes Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and Feeder Pipelines and Other.Southern Lights PipelineSouthern Lights Pipeline is a single stream pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. This 180,000 bpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline was placed into service in 2010. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights Canada) and the United States portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights US) receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity (18,000 bpd) assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes.Express-Platte SystemThe Express-Platte System consists of the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) crude oil transportation system, which begins in Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates in Wood River, Illinois. The Express pipeline carries crude oil to United States refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline in Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.Bakken SystemThe Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken in North Dakota, and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook, Minnesota for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The interstate portion of the system has both Unites States and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba.16Tariffs on the United States portion of the North Dakota System are governed by the FERC and include a local tariff. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis. Tolls on the interstate pipeline system are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.We have an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the United States Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the Dakota Access Pipeline from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Current capacity is 570,000 bpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.Feeder Pipelines and OtherFeeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the United States.Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates in Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. On July 1, 2014, Marathon executed an agreement with us to become an owner (35%) in SAX, thereby forming the Illinois Extension Pipeline Company (IEPC). We have a 65% ownership in IEPC. SAX was placed into service in December 2015 with the majority of its capacity commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480,000 barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost-of-service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.COMPETITIONOther competing carriers available to ship western Canadian liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the United States and internationally represent competition to our liquids pipelines network. Competition amongst existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets.Competition also arises from proposed pipelines that seek to access markets currently served by our liquids pipelines, such as proposed projects to the Gulf Coast and from proposed projects enhancing infrastructure in the Alberta regional oil sands market. The Mid-Continent and Bakken systems also face competition from existing pipelines, proposed future pipelines and existing and alternative gathering facilities. Competition for storage facilities in the United States includes large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently serviced by pipelines.17We believe that our liquids pipelines continue to provide attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) and North Dakota due to our competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system are expected to provide shippers reliable and long-term competitive solutions for liquids transportation. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers and our existing right-of-way for the Mainline System also provides a competitive advantage as it can be difficult and costly to obtain rights-of-way for new pipelines traversing new areas. In addition, we are currently pursuing the offering of contracted service on the Mainline System which would further contribute to mitigating competition risk.SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the United States, the world’s largest market for crude oil. While United States demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets.The International Energy Agency 2019 World Energy Outlook indicated that upstream investment in 2019 demonstrated a continued upward trend. International prices weakened in 2019 compared to the previous year with United States tensions with China and continued supply growth outside of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). World oil demand rose marginally over the year however, supply grew at a faster pace. The United States continued to increase its productive capacity, supported by its crude oil exports growing to over 3 million bpd in September 2019.In western Canada, lack of export pipeline capacity resulted in the rapid buildup of inventories and discounts to the price of western Canadian crude. Western Canadian Select discounts peaked at over US$50 per barrel against West Texas Intermediate (WTI) in October 2018. This, in turn, resulted in the Alberta Government approving a plan to lease 4,400 rail cars to add approximately 120,000 bpd of rail export capacity for the industry by the end of 2020 and the adoption of a production curtailment policy directing the industry in the province to shut in 325,000 bpd starting January 1, 2019. The aim of this policy was to both draw down inventories by approximately 20 million barrels and return crude discounts to more historical norms. The policy calls for curtailment levels to be reduced as inventory levels decline and new pipeline and rail capacity come on line. Western Canadian crude prices responded almost immediately upon the release of the curtailment adoption notice, with discounts narrowing to approximately US$10 per barrel. The discount at this level would imply that rail is not financially attractive, and hence frustrating the government's efforts to draw down inventories. Rail movements dropped by more than 200,000 bpd between December 2018 and February 2019 as differentials were narrow enough that it was not economic to ship crude by rail in the first quarter of 2019. The differentials widened to above $10 per barrel in subsequent quarters to support the return of crude by rail. Throughout the year, the curtailment levels declined to a year end restriction of 75,000 bpd with an expectation that Alberta production volumes will continue to increase in 2020.18Notwithstanding the current price environment and Alberta policies, our Mainline System has thus far continued to be highly utilized. Mainline throughput as measured at the Canada/United States border at Gretna, Manitoba saw record deliveries of 2.845 million bpd in December 2019, slightly higher than our previous record in July 2019. The Mainline System continues to be subject to apportionment, as nominated volumes currently exceed capacity on portions of the system. The impact of a low crude oil price environment on the financial performance of our Liquids Pipelines business is expected to be relatively modest given the cost effectiveness of our Mainline toll and commercial arrangements which underpin many of the pipelines providing a significant measure of protection against volume fluctuations. Our Mainline System is well positioned to continue to provide safe and efficient transportation which will enable western Canadian and Bakken production to reach attractive markets in the United States and eastern Canada at a competitive cost relative to other alternatives.The fundamentals of oil sands production and discounts for western Canadian crude have caused some sponsors to reconsider the timing of future projects. While recently updated forecasts continue to reflect long-term supply growth from the WCSB, the projected pace of growth is slower than previous forecasts as companies continue to assess the viability of capital investments in light of the current price environment and ongoing uncertainty with respect to the timing and completion of new pipeline systems proposed by our competitors. Over the long term, continued growth in global energy consumption is expected to be primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), mainly in India and China. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to moderate due to vehicle fuel efficiencies and increasing sales of electric vehicles. Accordingly, there is a strategic opportunity to establish tide-water export facilities to service North American producers wanting access to global markets.Global crude oil production is expected to continue to grow through 2035, primarily in North America, Brazil and OPEC. Growth in supply from OPEC is partly due to the expected recovery of Iraqi and Libyan production. Over the longer term, North American production from tight oil plays is expected to grow as technology continues to improve well productivity and efficiencies. The pace of growth in North America and level of investment in the WCSB could be tempered in future years by a number of factors including a sustained period of low crude oil prices and corresponding production decisions by OPEC, increasing environmental regulation and prolonged approval processes for new pipelines with access to tide-water for export or to United States markets.In recent years, the combination of relatively flat domestic demand, growing supply and long lead time to build pipeline infrastructure led to a fundamental change in the North American crude oil landscape. The inability to move increasing inland supply to markets resulted in a divergence between WTI and world pricing, resulting in lower netbacks for North American producers. The impact of price differentials has been even more pronounced for western Canadian producers as insufficient pipeline infrastructure resulted in a further discounting of Alberta crude relative to WTI. Canadian pipeline export capacity is expected to remain fully utilized, resulting in continued apportionment on our Mainline System and incremental production utilizing non-pipeline transportation services (e.g. rail and trucks) until such time as sufficient pipeline capacity is made available. Over the longer term, however, we believe pipelines will continue to be the most reliable, safe and cost-effective means of transportation.Our role in helping to address the evolving supply and demand fundamentals and alleviating price discounts for producers and supply costs to refiners is through optimization of throughput on our existing liquids pipelines systems and through investment in new pipelines and related infrastructure to provide expanded transportation capacity and sustainable connectivity to alternative markets. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7.

895728,ENB,ENBRIDGE INC,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Looking ahead, our near-term strategic priorities remain similar to years past. As always, proactively advancing the safety of communities, and protecting the environment, will always be our top priority. We are focused on enhancing the value of our existing assets in Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage and Renewable Power Generation and executing on our secured capital program. We will continue to capitalize on our liquids and natural gas pipeline infrastructure toward export-driven opportunities and focus on in-franchise growth in our gas utility as well as low carbon opportunities. Our Renewable Power Generation business, anchored by investments in contracted offshore wind power, compliments our low risk business model and supports our increasing focus on the energy transition. We will continue to invest in renewable power generation where we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns. Our key strategic priorities are summarized below:9Ensure Safe Reliable OperationsSafety and operational reliability remain the foundation of our strategy. Our commitment to safety and operational reliability means achieving and maintaining industry leadership in safety (process, public and personal) and ensuring the reliability and integrity of the systems we operate, in order to generate, transport and deliver energy while protecting people and the environment. Enhance Returns from our Base BusinessesA key priority is to drive growth through an ongoing focus on optimization, productivity and efficiency across all our businesses. Examples include throughput enhancements on our liquids system from the application of drag-reducing agents and improvements in scheduling logistics at our terminals, revenue optimization through negotiated toll settlements or rate cases, ongoing synergy capture following our utility merger and, more generally, creating sustainable cost savings across the organization through process improvement and/or system enhancements. Execute the Capital Program and Grow Core Business Successful project execution is integral to our financial performance and to the strategic positioning of our business over the long-term. Our ongoing objective is to deliver our slate of secured projects (currently $16 billion) at the lowest practical cost while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.In seeking to extend growth, we expect to have sufficient self-funding capacity, post completion of our secured capital program, to invest $5 to $6 billion per year in new organic growth capital without issuing any additional common equity and maintaining key credit metrics within planning parameters and targets established with credit rating agencies. We will remain disciplined and deploy capital towards the best uses, prioritizing balance sheet strength, investment in low capital intensity growth and regulated utility or utility-like projects. We will carefully deploy our remaining investable capacity to the most value enhancing opportunities including further organic growth and potential for share buybacks. Looking ahead, we see strong utilization of our existing network and opportunities for future growth within each of our four core businesses. For example:•Our liquids pipelines infrastructure will remain a vital connection between key supply basins and demand-pull markets, while a growing export market represents an opportunity to expand US Gulf Coast presence;•Our natural gas pipelines business will seek extension and expansion opportunities driven by new load demand from gas-fired power generation, industrial growth and coastal liquefaction plants;•Our gas distribution utility will continue to grow through customer additions, expansion of existing facilities and storage, reducing operating costs and blending hydrogen and RNG into its gas supply mix; and•Our growing capabilities in the offshore wind sector positions us well for continued growth, while self-powering of existing pipeline compressor stations represents a large opportunity.Maintain Financial Strength and Flexibility The maintenance of our financial strength is critical to our strategy. Our financing strategies are designed to retain strong, investment-grade credit ratings to ensure that we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions and respond to opportunities as they arise. Our current secured capital program, which extends to 2023, can be readily financed through internally generated cash flow and available balance sheet capacity without issuance of additional common equity and we will seek to secure new growth using this “self-funded” equity model. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.10Disciplined Capital Allocation We assess the latest fundamental trends, monitor the business landscape and proactively conduct business development activities with the goal of identifying an industry-leading opportunity set for capital deployment. Opportunities are screened, analyzed and assessed using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while maintaining our low-risk “utility-like” business model.All projects are evaluated based on their potential to advance our strategy, contain risk and create additional financial flexibility. Our primary emphasis in the near-term is on low capital intensity projects, modernization of our systems and utility rate-based investments. Execution risk remains high for large scale, long-duration development projects and, therefore, our focus will be on projects where we can carefully manage at-risk capital during the permitting and construction phases. In evaluating typical investment opportunities, we also consider other potential capital allocation choices that may add value. Other potential choices for capital deployment will depend on our current outlook and the size of our existing capital project backlog and could include dividend increases, further debt reduction or share re-purchases. Adapt to Energy Transition Over TimeAs the global population grows and standards of living continue to improve around the world, more energy will be needed. At the same time, our society increasingly recognizes the impacts of energy consumption on the world’s climate. Accordingly, energy systems are being reshaped as industry participants, regulators and consumers seek to balance competing objectives. As a diversified energy infrastructure company, we are well positioned to play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon economy while at the same time working to reduce our own emissions intensity. We believe that diversification and innovation will play a significant role in the transition to a low carbon future. To date, we have made large investments in natural gas infrastructure and continue to see significant opportunity in renewable energy, particularly offshore wind. Furthermore, we have tested our existing assets for various energy transition scenarios and concluded that they are highly resilient and can be relied upon for stable cash flow generation well into the future. STRATEGIC ENABLERSOur success in executing on our strategic priorities is very much enabled by our commitment to ESG issues, the quality and capabilities of our people and the extent to which we embrace technology and encourage innovation as a competitive advantage.ESGSustainability is integral to our ability to safely and reliably deliver the energy people need and want. How well we perform as a steward of our environment, a safe operator of essential energy infrastructure, a diverse and inclusive employer and a responsible corporate citizen is inextricably linked to our ability to achieve our strategic priorities and create long-term value for all stakeholders. 11Our commitment to strong ESG practices and performance has long been core to how we do business and we are proud to be recognized as a leader amongst our peers. In 2020, we set out ambitious goals including:•Net zero GHG emissions by 2050 with an interim target to reduce GHG emissions intensity 35% by 2030;•Increased representation of diverse groups within our workforce by 2025, including representation goals of 40% women and 28% racial and ethnic groups, along with new initiatives to enhance supplier diversity;•Strengthening diversity on our Board with representation goals of 40% women and 20% racial and ethnic groups by 2025; and•Annual safety and reliability targets that drive continuous improvement towards our goal of zero incidents, injuries and occupational injuries, and implementation of robust cyber defense programs.These goals represent the next stage of our progression to ensure we are positioned to grow our company sustainably for many decades to come. Beginning in 2021, we will measure ESG performance when determining incentive compensation. Achieving our goals will put us in a better position to successfully transition to a low carbon, more diverse and inclusive future. PeopleOur employees are essential to our long-term success and enhancing the capability of our people to maximize their potential is a key area of focus. We value diversity and have embedded inclusive practices throughout our programs and approach to people management. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives.TechnologyGiven the competitive climate of today’s energy sector, we recognize the vital role technology can play in helping us achieve our strategic objectives. Our two Technology and Innovation labs, located in Calgary and Houston, embody our commitment to technology enabled business solutions. Leveraging the benefits of technology to contribute to safety, reliability and the profitability of assets has become entrenched in our everyday operations.We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives in our annual Sustainability Report which can be found at https://www.enbridge.com/sustainability-reports. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.BUSINESS SEGMENTSOur activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution and Storage; Renewable Power Generation; and Energy Services, as discussed below.12LIQUIDS PIPELINESLiquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons.13MAINLINE SYSTEMThe Mainline System is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/US border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the US/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern US. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined capacity of approximately 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/US border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern US. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the Mainline System in the US. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from western Canada to the US.Competitive Toll SettlementThe Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) is the current framework governing tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. The 10-year settlement was negotiated by representatives of Enbridge, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and other shippers on the Canadian Mainline. It was approved by the National Energy Board (now the Canada Energy Regulator (CER)). The CTS provides for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada, on the Canadian Mainline, and delivered into the US, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. The IJT tolls are denominated in US dollars. The IJT is designed to provide shippers on the Mainline System with a stable and competitive long-term toll, thereby preserving and enhancing throughput on the Mainline System. The CLT and the IJT are adjusted annually, on July 1 of each year, at a rate equal to 75% of the Canadian Gross Domestic Product at Market Price Index published by Statistics Canada.Although the current CTS has a 10-year term and is in place until June 30, 2021, it does not require shippers to commit to certain volumes. Shippers nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Mainline System. Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by the CTS and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under the terms of the IJT agreement, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the IJT relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the US border is equal to the IJT applicable to that batch’s US delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. This amount is referred to as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll and is denominated in US dollars.Lakehead System Local TollsTransportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/US border near Neche, North Dakota, Clearbrook, Minnesota and other points to principal delivery points on the Lakehead System. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing index rates, and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1 of each year. To the extent that the Lakehead System transportation rates materially under-recover the Lakehead System cost of service, an application can be made with the FERC to seek approval to increase the rates in order to bring recoveries in-line with costs.14Mainline System Contracting On December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the CER to implement contracting on our Mainline System. The application for contracted and uncommitted service included the associated terms, conditions and tolls of each service, which would be offered in an open season following approval by the CER. The tolls and services would replace the current CTS that is in place until June 30, 2021. If a replacement agreement is not in place by June 30, 2021, the CTS provides for tolls to continue on an interim basis.For further information, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments - Mainline System Contracting. REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEMThe Regional Oil Sands System includes five intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines; the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which currently provide access for oil sands production from twelve producing oil sands projects.The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines is approximately 930 kbpd to Edmonton and 1,370 kbpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218 kbpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. We have a 50% interest in the Woodland Pipeline and a 70% interest in Norlite. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that provide cash flow stability and also include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system.GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENTGulf Coast includes Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South), Spearhead Pipeline and Gray Oak Pipeline, as well as the Mid-Continent System comprised of the Cushing Terminal.We have a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Total aggregate capacity on the Seaway Pipeline system is approximately 950 kbpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast.Flanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South has a capacity of approximately 600 kbpd.Spearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline has a capacity of approximately 193 kbpd.The Gray Oak pipeline is a 1,368-kilometer (850-mile) crude oil system, which runs from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the US Gulf Coast. The Gray Oak pipeline has an expected average annual capacity of 900 kbpd and transports light crude oil. We have an effective 22.8% interest in the pipeline. Initial in-service for the pipeline commenced in November 2019 with full service achieved in the second quarter of 2020.15The Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma (Cushing Terminal), consisting of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78 to 570 thousand barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder are contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, as well as blending fees.OTHEROther includes Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and Feeder Pipelines and Other.Southern Lights Pipeline is a single stream 180 kbpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline and the US portion of Southern Lights Pipeline receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes.The Express-Platte System consists of the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) long crude oil transportation system, which begins at Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates at Wood River, Illinois. The 310 kbpd Express pipeline carries crude oil to US refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The 145 to 164 kbpd Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline at Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.The Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken in North Dakota and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook, Minnesota for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The interstate portion of the system has both US and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba.Tariffs on the US portion of the North Dakota System are governed by the FERC and include a local tariff. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis. Tolls on the interstate pipeline system are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.We have an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the US Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the DAPL from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Current capacity is 570 kbpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.Feeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the US.16Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates in Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. We have an effective 65% interest in the 300 kbpd SAX pipeline of which the majority of its capacity is commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480 thousand barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The 101 kbpd Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The 45 kbpd NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost-of-service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.COMPETITIONOther competing carriers available to ship western Canadian liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the US and internationally represent competition to our liquids pipelines network. Competition amongst existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets.Competition also arises from proposed pipeline expansions that provide access to markets currently served by our liquids pipelines, as well as from proposed projects enhancing infrastructure in the Alberta regional oil sands market. The Mid-Continent and Bakken systems also face competition from existing pipelines, proposed future pipelines and existing and alternative gathering facilities. Competition for storage facilities in the US includes large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently served by pipelines.We believe that our liquids pipelines continue to provide attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) and North Dakota due to our competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system are expected to provide shippers reliable and long-term competitive solutions for liquids transportation. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers and our existing right-of-way for the Mainline System also provides a competitive advantage as it can be difficult and costly to obtain rights-of-way for new pipelines traversing new areas. In addition, we are currently pursuing the offering of contracted service on the Mainline System, which would further contribute to mitigating competition risk.SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the US, the world’s largest market for crude oil. While US demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets.The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the crude oil market in 2020. International prices weakened as lockdowns led to a reduction in energy consumption, lower refinery utilization and a glut in supply. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with producers around the world, cut crude oil production to stabilize international prices and inventories. WCSB production substantially recovered in the second half of the year as refinery demand has picked up and the Alberta production curtailment program has ended. 17Our Mainline System throughput, as measured at the Canada/US border at Gretna, Manitoba saw deliveries of 2.44 million bpd in the second quarter of 2020, a 400 kbpd drop from the previous quarter. Volumes improved in the third quarter to 2.55 million bpd and in the fourth quarter to 2.65 million bpd driven by improved refinery utilization in the US and Canada. The Mainline System also returned to apportionment in the fourth quarter, as heavy crude oil shipment nominations exceeded capacity on portions of the system. Lower supply of heavy crude from Latin America and the Middle East is driving increased demand for Canadian heavy crude in the US Gulf Coast even as refinery utilization remained below pre-pandemic levels. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial performance of our Liquids Pipelines business continues to be modest given the cost effectiveness of our Mainline System tolls and commercial arrangements, which underpin many of our pipelines. These arrangements provide a significant measure of protection against volume fluctuations. Our Mainline System is well positioned to continue to provide safe and efficient transportation which will enable western Canadian and Bakken production to reach attractive markets in the US and eastern Canada at a competitive cost.Over the long term, continued growth in global energy consumption is expected to be primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), mainly in India and China. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to moderate due to vehicle fuel efficiencies and increasing sales of electric vehicles. Accordingly, there is a strategic opportunity to establish tide-water export facilities to service North American producers wanting access to global markets.Global crude oil production is expected to continue to grow through 2035 to meet this increase in global demand. This supply will primarily come from OPEC countries and North America. Growth in supply from OPEC is partly due to the expected recovery of Iraqi and Libyan production. Saudi Arabia also has the capacity to increase production as necessary. The pace of growth in North America will be governed by a number of factors including crude oil prices, corresponding production decisions by OPEC, increasing environmental regulation, sufficient pipeline egress and prolonged approval processes for new pipelines with access to the US Gulf Coast and tide-water. Recent forecasts continue to show long-term supply growth from the WCSB, however the projected pace of growth is slower than previous forecasts as a result of the evolving factors noted above.In the near term, Canadian pipeline export capacity is expected to remain fully utilized, resulting in continued apportionment on our Mainline System and incremental production utilizing non-pipeline transportation services (e.g. rail and trucks) until such time as sufficient pipeline capacity is made available. Over the longer term, however, it will be important to develop additional WCSB pipeline egress alternatives as we believe pipelines will continue to be the most reliable, safe and cost-effective means of transportation.We help alleviate price discounts for producers and rising supply costs to refiners through optimization of throughput on our existing liquids pipelines systems and through investment in new pipelines and related infrastructure to provide expanded transportation capacity and sustainable connectivity to alternative markets. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7.

Vector can deliver 1.745 bcf/d of natural gas, of which 455 million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d) is leased to NEXUS. We have a 60% interest in Vector.Transmission and storage services are generally provided under firm agreements where customers reserve capacity in pipelines and storage facilities. The vast majority of these agreements provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of the actual volumes transported on the pipelines, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported, injected or withdrawn, which is intended to recover variable costs.Interruptible transmission and storage services are also available where customers can use capacity if it exists at the time of the request and are generally at a higher toll than long-term contracted rates. Interruptible revenues depend on the amount of volumes transported or stored and the associated rates for this service. Storage operations also provide a variety of other value-added services including natural gas parking, loaning and balancing services to meet customers’ needs.CANADIAN GAS TRANSMISSIONCanadian Gas Transmission is comprised of Westcoast Energy Inc.’s (Westcoast) British Columbia (BC) Pipeline, Alliance Pipeline and other minor midstream gas gathering pipelines.BC Pipeline has a peak day capacity of 2.9 bcf/d of natural gas on approximately 2,900-kilometers (1,800-miles) of transmission pipeline in British Columbia and Alberta that includes associated mainline compressor stations.

These pipelines are located in four major corridors in the Gulf of Mexico, extending to deepwater developments, and include almost 2,100-kilometers (1,300-miles) of underwater pipe and onshore facilities with total capacity of approximately 6.5 bcf/d.COMPETITIONOur natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The flow pattern of natural gas is changing across North America due to emerging supply sources and evolving demand centers, which creates competition for growth opportunities. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, nuclear and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.Competition exists in all markets that our businesses serve. Competitors include interstate/interprovincial and intrastate/intraprovincial pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies.SUPPLY AND DEMANDOur gas transmission assets make up one of the largest natural gas transportation networks in North America, driving connectivity between prolific supply basins and major demand centers within the continent. Our systems have been integral to the transition in natural gas fundamentals over the last decade and will continue to play a part as the energy landscape evolves. Shifts in production and consumption, both domestic and foreign, will require that we continue to serve as a critical link between markets.22In 2010, natural gas production in each of the Appalachian and Permian basins were less than 5.0 bcf/d each. Today, these regions produce more than 43.0 bcf/d of natural gas on a combined basis. Improved technology and increased shale gas drilling have increased the supply of low-cost natural gas. As well, there has been and continues to be a corresponding increase in demand for our natural gas infrastructure in North America. Through a series of expansions and reversals on our core systems, combined with the execution of greenfield projects and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to meet the needs of producers and consumers alike. Our US Gas Transmission systems were initially designed to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast to the supply starved northeast markets. Our asset base now has the capability to transport diverse bi-directional supply to the northeast, southeast, midwest, Gulf Coast and LNG markets on a fully subscribed and highly utilized basis.The northeast market continues its role as a predominantly supply constrained region with steady demand into 2040. The bi-directional capabilities offered by our US Gas Transmission system allows us to deliver in an efficient manner to our regional customers. The region has seen an increase in natural gas supply due to the development of the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachia region.The southeast market is linked to multiple, highly liquid supply pools that include the Marcellus and Utica shale developments, offering consistent supply and stable pricing to a growing population of end-use customers across our multiple systems under long term, utility-like arrangements.With connectivity to Appalachian and western Canadian supply through our systems, the midwest market has access to two of the lowest cost gas producing regions on the continent. As demand in the region is expected to continue to grow by approximately 2.3 bcf/d over the next two decades, maintaining this link will remain important. Flexibility in supply for this market is especially critical to maintaining liquidity and price stability as natural gas continues to replace coal-fired generation.Gulf Coast demand growth is being driven by an ongoing wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities, along with power generation, an increase in the volume of LNG exports and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Demand to these markets in the region is anticipated to grow by more than 23.0 bcf/d through 2040. The Gulf Coast market has been the beneficiary of low cost capacity on our assets as the relationship between supply and market centers has shifted. Such cost-effective capacity is difficult to access or replicate, offering existing shippers and transporters stability of capacity and utilization. Tide-water market access and proximity to Mexico continue to make this region a platform of global trade as pipeline and LNG exports continue their growth trajectory. The US exported over 9 bcf/d of natural gas to LNG markets, primarily from the Gulf Coast region, at the end of 2020.Despite there being strong growth in both supply and demand in the US, a lack of adequate transportation capacity has placed downward pressure on local natural gas pricing. The Appalachian Basin has seen price differentials of $1.00 to $2.00 per million British Thermal Units relative to Henry Hub in the Gulf Coast over the last few years. Unlike the dry gas production of the Marcellus, natural gas production growth in the Permian Basin is a result of robust crude oil production taking place in the region. Gas supplies from the region remained above prior year levels on average throughout 2020.Western Canada, not unlike other supply hubs, is a source of low-cost supply seeking access to premium markets in North America and globally. One of the few vital links to demand centers in the pacific northwest are our own systems in the region, which are highly utilized.23Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 23% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. Natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand as gas consumption is anticipated to grow by approximately 30% during this period as one of the world’s fastest growing energy sources. North American exports will play a significant part in meeting global demand, underscoring the ability of our assets to remain highly utilized by shippers, and highlighting the need for incremental transportation solutions across North America. In response to these global fundamentals, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to shippers. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investments in Canadian and US gas transportation facilities. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGEGas Distribution and Storage consists of our natural gas utility operations, the core of which is Enbridge Gas Inc. (Enbridge Gas), which serves residential, commercial and industrial customers throughout Ontario. This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Québec and an investment in Noverco Inc. (Noverco).ENBRIDGE GAS Enbridge Gas is a rate-regulated natural gas distribution utility with storage and transmission services that have been in operation for 172 years. Enbridge Gas serves approximately 75% of Ontario residents via approximately 3.8 million residential, commercial and industrial meter connections.There are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which Enbridge Gas is directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage.24DistributionEnbridge Gas’ principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis, without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract. The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts. Under a firm contract, Enbridge Gas is obligated to deliver natural gas to the customer up to a maximum daily volume. The service provided under an interruptible contract is similar to that of a firm contract, except that it allows for service interruption at Enbridge Gas’ option primarily to meet seasonal or peak demands. The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) approves rates for both contract and general services. The distribution system consists of approximately 146,000-kilometers (90,720-miles) of pipelines that carry natural gas from the point of local supply to customers.Customers have a choice with respect to natural gas supply. Customers may purchase and deliver their own natural gas to points upstream of the distribution system or directly into Enbridge Gas’ distribution system, or, alternatively, they may choose a system supply option, whereby customers purchase natural gas from Enbridge Gas’ supply portfolio. To acquire the necessary volume of natural gas to serve its customers, Enbridge Gas maintains a diversified natural gas supply portfolio, acquiring supplies on a delivered basis in Ontario, as well as acquiring supply from multiple supply basins across North America.TransportationEnbridge Gas contracts for firm transportation service, primarily with TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TransCanada), Vector and NEXUS, to meet its annual natural gas supply requirements. The transportation service contracts are not directly linked with any particular source of natural gas supply. Separating transportation contracts from natural gas supply allows Enbridge Gas flexibility in obtaining its own natural gas supply and accommodating the requests of its direct purchase customers for assignment of TransCanada capacity. Enbridge Gas forecasts the natural gas supply needs of its customers, including the associated transportation and storage requirements.In addition to contracting for transportation service, Enbridge Gas offers firm and interruptible transportation services on its own Dawn-Parkway pipeline system. Enbridge Gas’ transmission system consists of approximately 5,500-kilometers (3,418-miles) of high-pressure pipeline and five mainline compressor stations and has an effective peak daily demand capacity of 7.6 bcf/d. Enbridge Gas’ transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at the Tecumseh Gas Storage facility and Dawn Hub (collectively, Dawn) to major Canadian and US markets, and forms an important link in moving natural gas from western Canada and US supply basins to central Canadian and northeastern US markets.As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario continues to grow, there is an increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern US. Enbridge Gas delivered 1,793 bcf of gas through its distribution and transmission system in 2020. A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas’ transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately 13.5 years and the longest remaining contract term being 22 years.StorageEnbridge Gas’ business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits Enbridge Gas to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off-peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice permits Enbridge Gas to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing its overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to Enbridge Gas’ franchise areas.25Enbridge Gas’ storage facility at Dawn is located in southwestern Ontario, and has a total working capacity of approximately 276 bcf in 34 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. Dawn is the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada and one of the largest in North America. Approximately 180 bcf of the total working capacity is available to Enbridge Gas for utility operations. Enbridge Gas also has storage contracts with third parties for 21 bcf of storage capacity.Dawn offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canadian and US supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeast US. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. During 2020, Dawn provided services such as storage, balancing, gas loans, transport, exchange and peaking services to over 200 counterparties.A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas’ storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately four years and the longest remaining contract term being 16 years.NOVERCONoverco is a holding company that wholly-owns Énergir, LP (Énergir), formerly known as Gaz Metro Limited Partnership, a natural gas distribution company operating in Quebec, with interests in subsidiary companies operating gas transmission, gas distribution and power distribution businesses in Québec and Vermont. Énergir serves approximately 525,000 residential and industrial customers and is regulated by the Québec Régie de l’énergie and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. Noverco also holds an investment in our common shares. We own an equity interest in Noverco through ownership of 38.9% of its common shares and an investment in its preferred shares.GAZIFÈREWe wholly own Gazifère, a natural gas distribution company that serves approximately 43,000 customers in western Québec, a market not served by Énergir. Gazifère is regulated by the Québec Régie de l’énergie.COMPETITIONEnbridge Gas’ distribution system is regulated by the OEB and is subject to regulation in a number of areas, including rates. Enbridge Gas is not generally subject to third-party competition within its distribution franchise areas.Enbridge Gas competes with other forms of energy available to its customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include weather, price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and other factors.SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe expect that demand for natural gas in North America will continue to see low annual growth over the long term with continued growth in peak day demands. We expect demand for natural gas connections in Ontario to continue to grow due to continued population growth. Some modest growth driven by low natural gas prices is expected to continue given the significant price advantage relative to alternate energy options, even with increasing carbon charges, with specific interest coming from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas. Enbridge Gas continues to focus on promoting conservation and energy efficiency by undertaking activities focused on reducing natural gas consumption through various demand side management programs offered across all markets.26The storage and transportation marketplace continues to respond to changing natural gas supply dynamics including a robust supply environment. In recent years, the robust North American gas supply balance, due mainly to the development of unconventional gas volumes including the Alberta, British Columbia, Marcellus and Utica supply basins, has resulted in lower commodity prices and narrower seasonal price spreads. Unregulated storage values are primarily determined based on the difference in value between winter and summer natural gas prices. Storage values have been relatively stable to slightly rising as the North American natural gas supply and demand slowly returned to a more balanced position.27RENEWABLE POWER GENERATIONRenewable Power Generation consists primarily of investments in wind and solar assets, as well as geothermal, waste heat recovery, and transmission assets. In North America, assets are primarily located in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Québec and in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia. In Europe, we hold equity interests in operating offshore wind facilities in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as in several projects under construction and active development in France. Further, we are pursuing new European development opportunities through Maple Power Ltd., a joint venture in which we hold a 50% interest.28Combined Renewable Power Generation investments represent approximately 1,977 MW of net generation capacity. Of this amount, approximately:•1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;•255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;•211 MW will be generated by the Saint-Nazaire and Fécamp Offshore Wind projects, both of which are currently under construction; and•80 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation, with an additional 13 MW in projects under construction.The vast majority of the power produced from these facilities is sold under long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).Renewable Power Generation also includes the East-West Tie, a 450-MW transmission line in northwestern Ontario, which is currently under construction and is expected to reach commercial operation in the first half of 2022. In May 2020, we sold the Montana-Alberta Tie-Line (MATL), a 300-MW transmission line running from Great Falls, Montana to Lethbridge, Alberta.

Our commitment to safety and operational reliability means achieving and maintaining industry leadership in safety (process, public and personal) and ensuring the reliability and integrity of the systems we operate, in order to generate, transport and deliver energy while protecting people and the environment. Enhance Returns from our Base BusinessesA key priority is to drive growth through an ongoing focus on optimization, productivity, and efficiency across all our businesses. Examples include: the application of drag-reducing agents and pump station horsepower additions to optimize throughput on our liquids system, the execution of toll settlements and rate case filings to optimize revenue within our gas transmission franchises, the expansion of low-carbon gas offerings to modernize and integrate value chains at our gas utility, and more generally, and the creation of sustainable cost savings across the organization through process improvement and/or system enhancements. Execute the Capital Program and Grow Core Business Successful project execution is integral to our financial performance and to the strategic positioning of our business over the long term. Our ongoing objective is to deliver our slate of secured projects (currently $9 billion through 2024) at the lowest practical cost while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.In seeking to extend growth, we expect to have sufficient self-funding capacity of about $5 to $6 billion per year to invest in new organic growth capital without issuing any additional common equity and maintaining key credit metrics. We will remain disciplined and deploy capital towards the best uses, prioritizing balance sheet strength, investment in low capital intensity growth and regulated utility or utility-like projects. We will carefully assess our remaining investable capacity, deploying capital to the most value-enhancing opportunities available to us, including further organic growth, asset acquisitions, and share buybacks, or further deleveraging our balance sheet.Looking ahead, we see strong utilization of our existing network and opportunities for future growth within each of our businesses. For example:•Our liquids pipelines infrastructure will remain a vital connection between key supply basins and demand-pull markets such as the refinery hubs in the US Midwest, Eastern Canada, and the US Gulf Coast. The emergence of CCS offers the potential to provide new growth opportunities over the long term.10•Our natural gas pipelines business will seek extension and expansion opportunities driven by new load demand from gas-fired power generation, industrial growth, and coastal liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants. Looking forward, blending RNG and H2 production projects into our system will enhance asset longevity and enable us to offer a differentiated low-carbon service to customers.•Our gas distribution utility will continue to grow through customer additions, productivity enhancements, modernization investments and facilities that blend H2 and RNG into gas supply, and expansion of our demand-side management and distributed energy programs.•Our mature capabilities in the offshore and onshore wind sector position us well to compete for new projects across the development cycle in Europe and North America, while our multi-year program to self-power existing pipeline compressor stations represents highly visible and scalable growth.Maintain Financial Strength and Flexibility The maintenance of our financial strength is critical to our strategy. Our financing strategies are designed to retain strong investment-grade credit ratings to ensure that we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions. Our current secured capital program, which extends to 2024, can be readily financed through internally generated cash flow and available balance sheet capacity without issuance of additional common equity and we will seek to secure new growth within our “self-funded” equity model. In addition, we continue to look at opportunities to monetize non-core assets at attractive valuations. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.Disciplined Capital Allocation We assess the latest fundamental trends, monitor the business landscape and proactively conduct business development activities with the goal of identifying an industry-leading opportunity set for capital deployment. Opportunities are screened, analyzed and assessed using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining our low-risk “utility-like” business model.All investment opportunities are evaluated based on their potential to advance our strategy, mitigate risk, support our ESG goals, and create additional financial flexibility. Our primary emphasis in the near term is on low capital-intensive opportunities to enhance returns in existing businesses (organic expansions and optimizations), modernization of our systems and utility rate-based investments. Execution risk remains high for large scale, long-duration development projects and, therefore, our focus will be on projects where we can carefully manage at-risk capital during the permitting and construction phases. In evaluating typical investment opportunities, we also consider other potential capital allocation alternatives. Other alternatives for capital deployment depend on our current outlook and include further dividend increases, further debt reduction, and/or share re-purchases. Adapt to Energy Transition Over TimeAs the global population grows and standards of living continue to improve around the world, more energy will be needed. At the same time, our society increasingly recognizes the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the world’s climate. Accordingly, energy systems are being reshaped as industry participants, regulators and consumers seek to lower emissions. As a diversified energy infrastructure company, we are well positioned to play a key role in the transition to a low-emissions economy by leading the development of the future energy systems and partnering with customers on their low-carbon strategies, while at the same time working to reduce our own emissions. Furthermore, we have tested our assets for various energy transition scenarios and concluded that they are highly resilient and can be relied upon for stable cash flow generation well into the future.11We believe that diversification and innovation will play a significant role in the transition to a low-carbon future. To date, we have made large investments in natural gas infrastructure and continue to see significant opportunity in renewable energy. Our focus areas in renewable energy remain in offshore wind and utility-scale onshore projects. We are also taking a leadership role in other low-carbon platforms like CCS, H2 and RNG where we can leverage our infrastructure capability and stakeholder relationships to accelerate growth and extend the value of our existing assets. Additionally, all new investments that we make will need to have a clear path to achieve net zero emissions.We recognize our customer's expectations of a transition to a lower-carbon economy and are working actively to be a differentiated service provider by leveraging our ESG leadership and world-class execution capabilities. STRATEGIC ENABLERSOur success in executing on our strategic priorities is enabled by our commitment to ESG, the quality and capabilities of our people, and the extent to which we embrace technology and innovation as a competitive advantage.ESGSustainability is integral to our ability to safely and reliably deliver the energy people need and want. How well we perform as a steward of our environment; as a safe operator of essential energy infrastructure; as a diverse and inclusive employer; and as a responsible corporate citizen is inextricably linked to our ability to achieve our strategic priorities and create long-term value for all stakeholders. Our commitment to strong ESG practices and performance has long been core to how we do business and we are proud to be recognized as a leader amongst our peers. In 2020, we set out ambitious goals1 including:•Net zero GHG emissions by 2050 with an interim target to reduce GHG emissions intensity 35% by 2030 compared to the 2018 baseline.•Increased representation of diverse groups within our workforce by 2025, including representation goals of 40% women and 28% racial and ethnic groups, along with new initiatives to enhance supplier diversity.•Strengthening diversity on our Board with representation goals of 40% women and 20% racial and ethnic groups by 2025.•Annual safety and reliability targets that drive continuous improvement towards our goal of zero incidents, injuries, and implementation of robust cyber defense programs.Beginning in 2021, we began linking ESG performance to incentive compensation and are making meaningful progress toward these targets by executing on specific action plans. In addition, we issued our first sustainability-linked loan and sustainability-linked bond that ties our financing to our ESG goals. 1 All percentages or specific goals regarding inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility are aspirational goals which we intend to achieve in a manner compliant with state, local, provincial and federal law, including, but not limited to, US federal regulations, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Department of Labor and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.12Enbridge aims to continuously strengthen its approach to emissions reporting and reduction and is expanding its approach to include the following additional actions:•Ensure that investment decision making aligns with Enbridge’s interim and long-term emissions reduction goals.•Continue to proactively work with the organizations developing science-based guidelines for emissions targets in the midstream sector.•Work with key suppliers to support the further reduction of Scope 3 emissions.•Further develop low carbon energy partnerships to drive innovation across our business, with a focus on renewable power, renewable natural gas, hydrogen and carbon capture.Achieving our goals will put us in a better position to successfully transition to a low-carbon, more diverse, and inclusive future.PeopleOur employees are essential to our long-term success and enhancing the capability of our people to maximize their potential is a key area of focus. We value diversity, and diverse thought, and have embedded inclusive practices in our programs and approach to people management. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation, flexibility, and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives.TechnologyGiven the competitive climate of today’s energy sector, we recognize the vital role technology can play in helping to achieve our strategic objectives. We’re committed to pursuing innovation and technology solutions that further improve our safety performance, maximize revenues, improve efficiencies, and enable transition to new, cleaner energy solutions. Our two Technology and Innovation labs, located in Calgary and Houston, embody our commitment to technology enabled business solutions. Leveraging the benefits of technology to contribute to safety, reliability and the profitability of assets has become entrenched in our everyday operations.We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives, along with our assumptions and other relevant information, in our annual Sustainability Report which can be found at https://www.enbridge.com/sustainability-reports. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website, including our annual Sustainability Report, is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.BUSINESS SEGMENTSOur activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution and Storage; Renewable Power Generation; and Energy Services, as discussed below.13LIQUIDS PIPELINESLiquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport and export various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons.14MAINLINE SYSTEMThe Mainline System is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/US border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the US/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern US. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined operating capacity of approximately 3.1 million barrels per day (mmbpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/US border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern US. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the Mainline System in the US. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from western Canada to the US.Tolling FrameworkThe Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) which governed tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis, expired on June 30, 2021. The CTS was a 10-year negotiated agreement and provided for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada, on the Canadian Mainline, and delivered into the US, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. The IJT tolls were denominated in US dollars. On December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to implement contracting on our Canadian Mainline System. On November 26, 2021, the CER denied the application on the basis that, among other things, contracting as proposed would result in a significant change to access the Canadian Mainline and potentially inequitable outcomes to some shippers and non-shippers without a compelling justification.Effective July 1, 2021, the Mainline System is on Interim Tolls which will remain in effect until new tolls are approved by the CER. In accordance with the terms of the CTS, Interim Tolls are equal to the CTS exit tolls on June 30, 2021 and are subject to finalization and adjustment applicable to the interim period, if any. We are currently exploring, with customers and other stakeholders, alternatives that may include: a modified and extended CTS, a new incentive rate-making agreement, or a cost-of-service rate-making structure. Any negotiated settlement would require CER approval before implementation. New tolling framework clarity is expected by 2023. Shippers continue to nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we continue to allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Mainline System. Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by Interim Tolls and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under Interim Tolls, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the toll relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the US border is equal to the toll applicable to that batch’s US delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. While on Interim Tolls, we will continue to refer to this amount as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll which is denominated in US dollars.15Lakehead System Local TollsTransportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/US border near Neche, North Dakota, Clearbrook, Minnesota and other points to principal delivery points on the Lakehead System. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual inflationary adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing base rates and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1 of each year. To the extent that the Lakehead System transportation rates materially under-recover the Lakehead System cost of service, an application can be made with the FERC to seek approval to increase the rates in order to bring recoveries in-line with costs.On May 21, 2021, we filed a cost-of-service application to raise our base rates effective July 1, 2021. On June 30, 2021, the FERC issued an order to accept the rates subject to refund. This matter is currently in the FERC settlement process.REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEMThe Regional Oil Sands System includes five intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines; the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which currently provide access for oil sands production from twelve producing oil sands projects.The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines is approximately 1,090 kbpd to Edmonton and 1,370 kbpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218 kbpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. We have a 50% interest in the Woodland Pipeline and a 70% interest in Norlite. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that provide cash flow stability and also include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system.GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENTGulf Coast includes Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South), Spearhead Pipeline, Gray Oak Pipeline and the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC), as well as the Mid-Continent System (Cushing Terminal).We have a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Total aggregate capacity on the Seaway Pipeline system is approximately 950 kbpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast.Flanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South has a capacity of approximately 600 kbpd.Spearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline has a capacity of approximately 193 kbpd.16The Gray Oak pipeline is a 1,368-kilometer (850-mile) crude oil system, which runs from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the US Gulf Coast. The Gray Oak pipeline has an expected average annual capacity of 900 kbpd and transports light crude oil. We have an effective 22.8% interest in the pipeline. Initial in-service for the pipeline commenced in November 2019 with full service achieved in the second quarter of 2020.The Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma (Cushing Terminal), consisting of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78 to 570 thousand barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder are contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, as well as blending fees.In October 2021, we acquired a 100 percent operating interest in the Ingleside Energy Center (renamed the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC)), located near Corpus Christi, Texas. This terminal is comprised of 15.6 million barrels of storage and 1.5 million barrels per day of export capacity. We also acquired a 20% interest in the 670-kbpd Cactus II Pipeline, a 100% interest in the 300-kbpd Viola pipeline, and a 100% interest in the 350-thousand-barrel Taft Terminal.OTHEROther includes Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and Feeder Pipelines and Other.Southern Lights Pipeline is a single stream 180 kbpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline and the US portion of Southern Lights Pipeline receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes.The Express-Platte System consists of the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) long crude oil transportation system, which begins at Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates at Wood River, Illinois. The 310 kbpd Express pipeline carries crude oil to US refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The 145 to 164 kbpd Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline at Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.The Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken in North Dakota and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook, Minnesota for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The interstate portion of the system has both US and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba.Tariffs on the US portion of the North Dakota System are governed by the FERC. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis. Tolls on the interstate pipeline system are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.17We have an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the US Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the DAPL from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Current capacity is 750 kbpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.Feeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the US.Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates in Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. We have an effective 65% interest in the 300 kbpd SAX pipeline of which the majority of its capacity is commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480 thousand barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The 101 kbpd Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The 45 kbpd NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost-of-service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.COMPETITIONCompetition to our liquids pipelines network comes primarily from infrastructure or logistics alternatives that transport liquid hydrocarbons from production basins in, which we operate, to markets in Canada, the US and internationally. Competition from existing and proposed pipelines is based primarily on access to supply, end use markets, the cost of transportation, contract structure and the quality and reliability of service. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently served by pipelines.We believe that our liquids pipelines systems will continue to provide competitive and attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), North Dakota, and more recently the Permian Basin, due to our market access, competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system will provide additional competitive solutions for liquids transportation. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers.SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the US, the world’s largest market for crude oil. While US demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets, both domestic and global.The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on the crude oil market in 2020 with decreased demand from the economic slowdown and government imposed mobility restrictions. However, 2021 has seen global crude oil demand recover to levels close to pre-pandemic highs. International prices have strengthened to multi-year highs as global demand has outpaced the return of supply as publicly traded producers have adopted a more disciplined approach to capital allocation for new drilling. 18Our Mainline System throughput, as measured at the Canada/US border at Gretna, Manitoba ended the year delivering 3.1 million barrels per day, as the Line 3 Replacement program has come into service. Refinery demand in the upper Midwest PADD II market has been strong given the economic recovery and enhanced mobility demand. On the US Gulf Coast, lower supply of heavy crude from Latin America and the Middle East is driving increased demand for Canadian heavy crude. Global crude oil demand in most base case forecasts is expected to grow into the next decade, primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), such as India and China. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to moderate over time due to vehicle fuel efficiency improvement and increasing sales of electric vehicles.New supply to meet this growing demand will primarily come from Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries and North America. Growth in supply from OPEC will be led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with their significant low cost reserves and could be supplemented by the return of sanctioned Iranian production. Growth in North America will be driven by the Permian Basin which is a large and cost competitive light crude oil resource base. In addition, heavy crude oil growth is expected from the WCSB as additional egress availability will support expansion of existing projects and some potential new greenfield facilities.The combination of long term demand growth in non-OECD nations, domestic demand contraction over time, and continued production growth in the Permian Basin and WCSB highlights the importance of our strategic asset footprint and reinforces the need for additional export oriented infrastructure. We are well positioned to meet these evolving supply and demand fundamentals through expansion of system capacity for incremental access to the US Gulf Coast, and through further development of our new Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center in Corpus Christi, the largest crude oil export facility in North America.Opposition to fossil fuel development in conjunction with evolving consumer preferences and new technology could underpin accelerated energy transition scenarios impacting long term supply and demand of crude oil. We continue to closely monitor the evolution of all of these factors to be able to pro-actively adapt our business to help meet our customers’ and society’s energy needs.Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II.

These facilities include the Palermo Conditioning Plant and the Prairie Rose Pipeline in the Bakken area of North Dakota, owned and operated by Aux Sable Midstream US; and Aux Sable Canada’s interests in the Montney area of BC, comprising the Septimus Pipeline. Aux Sable Canada also owns a facility which processes refinery/upgrader offgas in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.US Midstream also includes a 50% investment in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream), which indirectly owns approximately 57% of DCP Midstream, LP, including limited partner and general partner interests. DCP Midstream, LP is a master limited partnership, with a diversified portfolio of assets, engaged in the business of gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing and selling natural gas; producing, fractionating, transporting, storing and selling NGLs; and recovering and selling condensate. DCP Midstream, LP owns and operates more than 36 plants and approximately 90,123-kilometers (56,000-miles) of natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, with operations in nine states across major producing regions.OTHEROther consists primarily of our offshore assets. Enbridge Offshore Pipelines is comprised of 11 natural gas gathering and FERC regulated transmission pipelines and four oil pipelines. These pipelines are located in four major corridors in the Gulf of Mexico, extending to deepwater developments, and include almost 2,100-kilometers (1,300-miles) of underwater pipe and onshore facilities with total capacity of approximately 6.5 bcf/d.COMPETITIONOur natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, nuclear and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.Competition exists in all markets that our businesses serve. Competitors include interstate/interprovincial and intrastate/intraprovincial pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies.SUPPLY AND DEMANDOur gas transmission assets make up one of the largest natural gas transportation networks in North America, driving connectivity between prolific supply basins and major demand centers within the continent. Our systems have been integral to the transition in supply and demand markets over the last decade and will continue to play a part as the energy landscape evolves. 23In 2010, natural gas production in each of the Appalachian and Permian basins were less than 5.0 bcf/d each. Today, these regions produce more than 47.5 bcf/d of natural gas on a combined basis. Improved technology and increased shale gas drilling have increased the supply of low-cost natural gas. As well, there has been and continues to be a corresponding increase in demand for our natural gas infrastructure in North America. Through a series of expansions and reversals on our core systems, combined with the execution of greenfield projects and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to meet the needs of producers and consumers alike. Our US Gas Transmission systems were initially designed to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast to the supply starved northeast markets. Our asset base now has the capability to transport diverse bi-directional supply to the northeast, southeast, midwest, Gulf Coast and LNG markets on a fully subscribed and highly utilized basis.The northeast market continues its role as a predominantly supply constrained region with steady demand. The bi-directional capabilities offered by our US Gas Transmission system allows us to deliver in an efficient manner to our regional customers. The region has seen an increase in natural gas supply due to the development of the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachia region.The southeast market is linked to multiple, highly liquid supply pools that include the Marcellus and Utica shale developments, offering consistent supply and stable pricing to a growing population of end-use customers across our multiple systems under long term, utility-like arrangements.With connectivity to Appalachian and western Canadian supply through our systems, the midwest market has access to two of the lowest cost gas producing regions on the continent. As demand in the region is expected to continue to grow by approximately 2.0 bcf/d over the next two decades, maintaining this link will remain important. Flexibility in supply for this market is especially critical to maintaining liquidity and price stability as natural gas continues to replace coal-fired generation.Gulf Coast demand growth is being driven by an increase in the volume of LNG exports, an ongoing wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities, along with power generation and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Demand to these markets in the region is anticipated to grow by more than 23.0 bcf/d through 2040. The Gulf Coast market has been the beneficiary of low cost capacity on our assets as the relationship between supply and market centers has shifted. Such cost-effective capacity is difficult to access or replicate, offering existing shippers and transporters stability of capacity and utilization. Tide-water market access and proximity to Mexico continue to make this region a platform of global trade as pipeline and LNG exports continue their growth trajectory. The US exported over 11 bcf/d of natural gas to LNG markets, primarily from the Gulf Coast region, at the end of 2021.Western Canada, not unlike other supply hubs, is a source of low-cost supply seeking access to premium markets in North America and globally. One of the few vital links to demand centers in the pacific northwest are our own systems in the region, which are highly utilized.Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 27% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. Natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand as gas consumption is anticipated to grow by approximately 23% during this period as one of the world’s fastest growing energy sources. North American exports will play a significant part in meeting global demand, underscoring the ability of our assets to remain highly utilized by shippers, and highlighting the need for incremental transportation solutions across North America. In response to these global fundamentals, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to shippers. Opposition to natural gas development, including new pipeline projects, has been increasing in recent years. This may challenge continued growth of the North American gas market and the ability to efficiently connect supply and demand. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investments in Canadian and US gas transportation facilities.

BUSINESSEnbridge is a leading North American energy infrastructure company. Our core businesses include Liquids Pipelines, which consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport and export various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons; Gas Transmission and Midstream, which consists of investments in natural gas pipelines and gathering and processing facilities in Canada and the US; Gas Distribution and Storage, which consists of natural gas utility operations that serve residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ontario and Québec; and Renewable Power Generation, which consists primarily of investments in wind and solar assets, as well as geothermal, waste heat recovery and transmission assets, in North America and Europe.Enbridge is a public company, with common shares that trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ENB. We were incorporated on April 13, 1970 under the Companies Ordinance of the Northwest Territories and were continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act on December 15, 1987.A more detailed description of each of our businesses and underlying assets is provided below under Business Segments.CORPORATE VISION AND STRATEGYVISIONOur primary purpose as a company is to fuel people’s quality of life in a safe, clean, and socially responsible manner. Our vision to be the leading energy infrastructure company in North America and beyond supports this purpose. In pursuing this vision, we seek to play a critical role in enabling the economic and social well-being of people across the world by providing access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Our infrastructure franchises transport, distribute, and generate energy, including liquids, natural gas, renewable power, and lower-carbon fuels. We recognize that the energy system is changing, and we aim to bridge to a cleaner energy future by investing in lower-carbon platforms while ensuring the continuity and stability that the world requires through the transition.Our investor value proposition is founded on our ability to deliver predictable cash flows and a growing stream of dividends year-over-year through investment in, and efficient operation of, energy infrastructure assets that are strategically positioned between key supply basins and strong demand-pull markets. Our assets are underpinned by long-term contracts, regulated cost-of-service tolling frameworks, power purchase agreements (PPAs), and other low-risk commercial arrangements.In addition, we strive to be a leader in worker and public safety, ESG, stakeholder relations, customer service, community investment, and employee engagement and satisfaction.STRATEGYOur strategy is underpinned by a deep understanding of energy supply and demand fundamentals. Through disciplined capital allocation that is aligned with our outlook on energy markets, we have become an industry leader with a diversified portfolio across both conventional and lower-carbon energies. Our assets have reliably generated low-risk, resilient cash flows through many commodity and economic cycles.8In order to continue to be an industry leader and value creator going forward, we maintain a robust strategic planning approach. We regularly conduct scenario and resiliency analysis on both our assets and business strategy. We test various value enhancement and maximization options, and we regularly engage with our Board of Directors (the Board) to ensure alignment and maintain active oversight, including updates and discussions throughout the year and a dedicated annual Strategic Planning session. Going forward, we plan to use this comprehensive approach to guide our investment and portfolio decisions.Predictable growth is a hallmark of our investor value proposition. Our robust portfolio of project development opportunities and ongoing efficiency improvements should help drive mid-single digit growth in our distributable cash flow per share for years to come. We remain confident in our two-pronged growth strategy and expect to selectively invest in our diversified footprint of both conventional businesses and complementary lower-carbon platforms, such as renewables, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Hydrogen (H2), and Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). Additionally, ESG continues to be integral to our strategy; we are committed to reducing our emissions, building lasting relationships with our stakeholders, and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.In alignment with our strategy, we progressed several of our priorities in 2022. For example:•Our Liquids Pipelines business delivered record Mainline volumes, increased ownership in and operatorship of the Gray Oak pipeline, and permitted a 2 million barrels (mmbl) storage expansion at Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC), further bolstering our presence in the US Gulf Coast and global export markets.•Our Gas Transmission and Midstream business successfully expanded our secured capital program notably with the T-South Expansion Program and T-North Expansion Program and acquired an equity stake in Woodfibre LNG Limited Partnership to capitalize on increasing global gas demand and supporting coal-to-gas conversions that are expected to help lower global energy emissions.•Our Gas Distribution and Storage business added over 45,000 new customers, filed the rate rebasing application for 2024-2028 which proposes continuation of Incentive Rate-setting mechanisms, completed the Pathways to Net-Zero Emissions Study for Ontario, and progressed construction of three RNG projects and development of a green hydrogen blending project at Gazifère Inc. (Gazifère), a wholly-owned natural gas distribution company in Québec.•Our Renewable Power Generation business accelerated its growth strategy with the acquisition of the renewable developer Tri Global Energy, LLC (TGE), securing 3.9 gigawatts (GW) of conditionally sold renewable generation projects and an additional 3 GW in development projects. In addition, the 480 megawatts (MW) Saint-Nazaire project, France’s first commercial-scale offshore wind in which Enbridge holds a stake, became fully operational in 2022. We are continuing to advance construction of three additional offshore wind projects in Europe.•Our New Energy Technologies team, in collaboration with all of our business units, advanced our lower-carbon strategy, including building strategic partnerships to progress the Wabamun Carbon Hub in Alberta and lower-carbon hydrogen and ammonia production and export facilities in the US Gulf Coast.•We have made meaningful progress towards our ESG goals, advancing construction of ten solar self-power projects, signing a landmark sale of a non-operating interest in pipelines in our Regional Oil Sands System to 23 Indigenous communities, and publishing our Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan to further our engagement.•We continue to recycle capital at attractive valuations, further optimizing and diversifying our portfolio. In addition, we are focused on improving efficiencies to increase our profitability and competitiveness.9These achievements are discussed in further detail in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Looking ahead, our near-term strategic priorities remain similar to years past. As always, proactively advancing the safety of our assets, protecting the environment, and maintaining reliability of our system remain our top priorities. We are focused on enhancing the value of our existing assets, capitalizing on our extensive infrastructure, prioritizing in-franchise organic growth and export-driven opportunities, and developing lower-carbon platforms across all our businesses. We will continue to invest where we can advance our strategy, build sustainable competitive advantage, and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.Our key strategic priorities include:Safety and Operational ReliabilitySafety and operational reliability are the foundation of our strategy. We strive to achieve and maintain industry leadership in all facets of safety - process, public, and personal - and ensure the highest standards of reliability and integrity across our system to protect our communities and the environment.Extend GrowthThe cornerstone of our growth lies in the successful execution of our slate of secured projects (currently $18 billion through 2028) on schedule and at the lowest practical cost, while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction, and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.Beyond that, we seek to continually identify additional high-quality growth opportunities across all our platforms. We expect to have sufficient equity self-funding capacity of about $5 to $6 billion per year to invest in growth without issuing any additional common equity and maintaining key credit metrics. We will remain disciplined and will strive to deploy capital towards the best uses, prioritizing balance sheet strength, investment in low capital intensity growth, and regulated utility or utility-like projects. We will carefully assess our remaining investable capacity, deploying capital to what we believe are the most value-enhancing opportunities available to us, including further organic growth, complementary accretive ""tuck-in"" acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning, share repurchases, or further deleveraging of our balance sheet.Looking ahead, we see strong utilization of our existing network and opportunities for future growth within each of our businesses. For example, we expect that:•Our liquids pipelines infrastructure will remain a vital connection between key supply basins and demand-pull markets such as the refinery hubs in the US Midwest, eastern Canada, and the US Gulf Coast. The emergence of CCS offers the potential to provide new growth opportunities over the long term.•Our natural gas transmission business will seek extension and expansion opportunities driven by new load demand from gas-fired power generation, industrial growth, and coastal LNG plants. Looking forward, blending RNG and H2 production into our system should enhance asset longevity and enable us to offer a differentiated lower-carbon solution to customers.•Our gas distribution and storage business will continue to grow through productivity enhancements, modernization investments, and facilities that blend H2 and RNG into the gas supply. We expect to continue to add customers over the next regulatory framework period to 2028. Additionally, we expect to expand our offerings to customers, including additional demand-side management, as well as resiliency and hybrid heating programs.10•Our enhanced renewable power capabilities position us well to capitalize on strong renewables growth in Europe and North America and execute on our large development program. We also plan to continue to progress our multi-year self-power program across our liquids and gas systems.In addition, we aim to drive growth through an ongoing focus on optimization, modernization, productivity, and efficiency across all our businesses. Examples include: the application of drag-reducing agents and pump station modifications to optimize throughput on our liquids system, the execution of toll settlements and rate case filings to optimize revenue within our gas transmission franchises, the expansion of lower-carbon offerings to utility customers and investments in lower-carbon supply connections to the gas grid, and more generally, the creation of sustainable cost savings across the organization through innovation, process improvement and/or system enhancements.Maintain a Strong Balance SheetThe maintenance of our balance sheet strength is critical to our strategy. Our financing strategies are designed to retain strong, investment-grade credit ratings to ensure we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions. Our current secured capital program can be readily financed through internally generated cash flow and available balance sheet capacity without issuance of additional common equity. We will seek to secure new growth within our ""self-funded"" equity model. In addition, we continue to look at opportunities to monetize non-core assets at attractive valuations. For further discussion on our financing strategies refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.Disciplined Capital AllocationWe assess the latest fundamental trends, monitor the business landscape, and proactively conduct business development activities with the goal of identifying an industry-leading capital deployment opportunity set. We screen, analyze, and assess opportunities using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of effectively deploying capital to grow while achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns, within our low-risk ""utility-like"" business model.All investment opportunities are evaluated based on their potential to advance our strategy, mitigate risks, support our ESG goals, and create additional financial flexibility. Our primary emphasis in the near term is on low capital intensity opportunities to enhance returns in existing businesses (organic expansions and optimizations), modernization of our systems, and utility rate-based investments. We also remain focused on larger projects where commercial constructs fit our investor value proposition and where we can effectively manage risks during the execution phase. In addition, we continue to assess other value-enhancing opportunities, such as accretive acquisitions that can complement our portfolio.In evaluating typical investment opportunities, we also consider other potential capital allocation alternatives. Other alternatives for capital deployment depend on our current outlook and include further dividend increases, further debt reduction, and/or share repurchases.Lead in Energy Transition Over TimeAs the global population grows and standards of living continue to improve around the world, we expect energy demand to rise. At the same time, we, and our society, increasingly recognize the need for secure and reliable energy while reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accordingly, energy systems around the world are being reshaped as industry participants, regulators, and consumers seek to lower emissions. As a diversified energy infrastructure company, we believe we are well positioned to play a key role in the energy transition by leading the development of the future energy systems with regulators and policy makers and partnering with customers on their lower-carbon strategies, while reducing our own carbon footprint.11We believe that diversification and innovation will play a significant role in the transition to a lower-carbon future. To date, we have made large investments in natural gas infrastructure and renewable energy assets, helping to decrease our emissions and further expand our platforms to enable energy transition across the globe. Our focus areas in renewable energy remain in offshore wind, utility-scale onshore projects, and integrated clean-energy offerings and solutions for customers. We are also taking a leadership role in other lower-carbon platforms like CCS, H2 and RNG where we can leverage our infrastructure, capabilities, and stakeholder relationships to accelerate growth and extend the value of our existing assets. Additionally, our new investments are expected to have a clear path to achieve net-zero emissions, in alignment with our ESG goals.We work closely with our customers to maintain a pulse on the pace of the energy transition and are actively leveraging our ESG leadership and world-class execution capabilities to advance our positioning as a differentiated energy provider. We regularly test our assets under various transition scenarios to assess resiliency of our business.STRATEGIC ENABLERSOur commitment and progress on ESG, the capabilities and skills of our people, and how we utilize technology are core to executing our strategy and maintaining our competitive advantages.Environmental, Social and GovernanceSustainability is integral to our ability to deliver energy in a safe and reliable manner. How well we perform as a steward of our environment; as a safe operator of essential energy infrastructure; as a diverse and inclusive employer; and as a responsible corporate citizen is inextricably linked to our ability to achieve our strategic priorities and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.In 2022, we published our 21st annual Sustainability Report outlining our progress against our ESG goals1. In particular, we:•Made meaningful progress towards our interim emissions intensity and net-zero GHG emissions goals through modernization and innovation of our system, efficiency improvements, and continued investment in solar self-power;•Enhanced our efforts to ensure that our workforce and Board better reflect the diversity of our communities, empowering our workforce through employee resource groups and advancing on our diversity, equity, and inclusion commitments; and•Continued to drive improvements towards our goal of zero safety incidents and injuries and progressed implementation of robust cyber defense programs.Since setting our ESG targets in 2020, we have made considerable progress integrating sustainability into our strategy, governance, operations, and decision-making. We have linked ESG performance to incentive compensation and are making meaningful progress towards these targets by executing on our action plans.1All percentages or specific goals regarding inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility are aspirational goals which we intend to achieve in a manner compliant with state, local, provincial and federal law, including, but not limited to, US federal regulations, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Department of Labor and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.12At Enbridge, we aim to continuously strengthen our ESG approach and are undertaking the following additional actions:•Proactively working with organizations advancing science-based guidelines for the midstream sector;•Collaborating with key suppliers on emissions reduction plans; and•Further developing lower-carbon energy partnerships to drive innovation across our businesses, with a focus on renewable power, RNG, H2 and CCS.PeopleOur employees are essential to our success and our focus remains on enhancing the capabilities and skills of our people. We are evolving our people strategy to ensure we attract and retain the talent and leadership needed for today and tomorrow. This includes growing our focus on learning and development, and additional focus on overall well-being. We value diversity, and diverse thought, and have embedded inclusive practices in our programs, processes, and approach to people management. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation, flexibility, and retention programs that provide both short- and long-term performance incentives.TechnologyWe recognize the vital role technology plays in helping us achieve our strategic objectives. We are committed to pursuing innovation and technology solutions that further our safety and reliability, maximize revenues, improve efficiencies, and enable transition to new, cleaner energy solutions. We continue to strive to be on the leading edge of cyber security, by enhancing our capabilities and educating our workforce to protect our critical infrastructure system from increasing threats.Our two Technology and Innovation labs, located in Calgary and Houston, embody our commitment to technology enabled business solutions and how we strive to entrench technology in our everyday operations.We provide annual progress updates in our annual Sustainability Report which can be found at https://www.enbridge.com/sustainability-reports. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website, including our annual Sustainability Report, is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.BUSINESS SEGMENTSOur activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution and Storage; Renewable Power Generation; and Energy Services, as discussed below.13LIQUIDS PIPELINESLiquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and terminals in Canada and the US that transport and export various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons.14MAINLINE SYSTEMThe Mainline System is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/US border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the US/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern US. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined operating capacity of approximately 3.1 million barrels per day (mmbpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/US border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern US. Through our predecessors, we have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the Mainline System in the US. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from western Canada to the US.Tolling FrameworkThe Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) which governed tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis, expired on June 30, 2021. The CTS was a 10-year negotiated agreement and provided for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada, on the Canadian Mainline, and delivered into the US, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. The IJT tolls were denominated in US dollars.On December 19, 2019, we submitted an application to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to implement contracting on our Canadian Mainline System. On November 26, 2021, the CER denied the application on the basis that, among other things, contracting as proposed would result in a significant change to access on the Canadian Mainline and potentially inequitable outcomes to some shippers and non-shippers without a compelling justification.Effective July 1, 2021, the Mainline System is on Interim Tolls which will remain in effect until new tolls are approved by the CER. In accordance with the terms of the CTS, Interim Tolls are equal to the CTS exit tolls on June 30, 2021 and are subject to finalization and adjustment applicable to the interim period, if any. We are currently exploring, with customers and other stakeholders, alternatives that may include: a modified and extended CTS, a new incentive rate-making agreement, or a cost-of-service rate-making structure. Any negotiated settlement would require CER approval before implementation. New tolling framework clarity is expected in 2023.Shippers continue to nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we continue to allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Mainline System.Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by Interim Tolls and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements. Under Interim Tolls, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the toll relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the US border is equal to the toll applicable to that batch’s US delivery point, which is comprised of the IJT Benchmark Toll, the CTS Surcharges and the Line 3 Replacement IJT Surcharge, less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. While on Interim Tolls, we will continue to refer to this amount as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Toll which is denominated in US dollars.15Lakehead System Local TollsTransportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/US border near Neche, North Dakota, Clearbrook, Minnesota and other points to principal delivery points on the Lakehead System. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual inflationary adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing base rates and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1 of each year. To the extent that the Lakehead System transportation rates materially under-recover the Lakehead System cost of service, an application can be made with the FERC to seek approval to increase the rates in order to bring recoveries in-line with costs.On May 21, 2021, we filed a cost-of-service application to raise our base rates effective July 1, 2021. On June 30, 2021, the FERC issued an order to accept the rates subject to refund. This matter is currently in the FERC settlement process.REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEMThe Regional Oil Sands System includes five intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines: the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which currently provide access for oil sands production from twelve producing oil sands projects.The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long-haul pipelines is approximately 1,090 thousand barrels per day (kbpd) to Edmonton and 1,370 kbpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218 kbpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. We have a 50% interest in the Woodland Pipeline and a 70% interest in Norlite. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that provide cash flow stability and also include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system.On October 5, 2022, we completed a transaction with Athabasca Indigenous Investments Limited Partnership (Aii), a newly created entity representing 23 First Nation and Metis communities, pursuant to which Aii acquired an 11.6% non-operating interest in seven Regional Oil Sands pipelines in the Regional Oil Sands System. Pipelines included in the transaction are the Athabasca Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and associated tanks, Norlite, Waupisoo Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, and Woodland Extension.GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENTGulf Coast includes Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South), Spearhead Pipeline, Gray Oak Pipeline and the EIEC, as well as the Mid-Continent System (Cushing Terminal).We have a 50% interest in the 1,078 kilometer (670 mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805 kilometer (500 mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Total aggregate capacity on the Seaway Pipeline system is approximately 950 kbpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast.16Flanagan South is a 950 kilometer (590 mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South has a capacity of approximately 660 kbpd.Spearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline has a capacity of approximately 193 kbpd.The Gray Oak pipeline is a 1,368 kilometer (850 mile) crude oil system, which runs from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the US Gulf Coast. The Gray Oak pipeline has an expected average annual capacity of 900 kbpd and transports light crude oil. As of August 17, 2022, our effective economic interest in Gray Oak increased to 58.5% from 22.8% as a result of a joint venture merger transaction with Phillips 66 (P66) and we will be assuming operatorship of Gray Oak in the second quarter of 2023.The Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma (Cushing Terminal), consisting of over 110 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78 to 570 thousand barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 26 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder are contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, and blending fees.In October 2021, we acquired Moda Midstream Operating, LLC, which included the Ingleside Energy Center (renamed the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center or EIEC), located near Corpus Christi, Texas. This terminal is comprised of 15.6 million barrels of storage and 1.5 million barrels per day of export capacity. We also acquired a 20% interest in the 670-kbpd Cactus II Pipeline, a 100% interest in the 300-kbpd Viola pipeline, and a 100% interest in the 350-thousand-barrel Taft Terminal. In November 2022, we acquired an additional 10% ownership interest in Cactus II Pipeline, bringing our total non-operating ownership to 30%.OTHEROther includes Southern Lights Pipeline, Express-Platte System, Bakken System and Feeder Pipelines and Other.Southern Lights Pipeline is a single stream 180 kbpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline and the US portion of Southern Lights Pipeline receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes.The Express-Platte System consists of the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736 kilometer (1,700 mile) long crude oil transportation system, which begins at Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates at Wood River, Illinois. The 310 kbpd Express pipeline carries crude oil to US refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The 145 to 164 kbpd Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline at Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the Midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.17The Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken in North Dakota and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook, Minnesota for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The interstate portion of the system has both US and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba.Tariffs on the US portion of the North Dakota System are governed by the FERC. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the CER on a complaint basis. Tolls on the interstate pipeline system are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.We have an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the US Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline (ETCO) from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Current capacity is 750 kbpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.Feeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the US.Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates in Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. We have an effective 65% interest in the 300 kbpd SAX pipeline. The majority of the SAX pipeline's capacity is commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480 thousand barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The 101 kbpd Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The 45 kbpd NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost-of-service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.COMPETITIONCompetition for our liquids pipelines network comes primarily from infrastructure or logistics alternatives that transport liquid hydrocarbons from production basins in which we operate to markets in Canada, the US and internationally. Competition from existing and proposed pipelines is based primarily on access to supply, end use markets, the cost of transportation, contract structure and the quality and reliability of service. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently served by pipelines.We believe that our liquids pipelines systems will continue to provide competitive and attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), North Dakota, and the Permian Basin, due to our market access, competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers.18SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the US, the world’s largest market for crude oil. While we expect US demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets, both domestic and global.The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on the crude oil market in 2020 with decreased demand from the economic slowdown and government imposed mobility restrictions. However, since 2021, global crude oil demand has been recovering to levels close to pre-pandemic highs. International prices have strengthened to multi-year highs as global demand has outpaced the return of supply as publicly traded producers have adopted a more disciplined approach to capital allocation for new drilling.Our Mainline System throughput, as measured at the Canada/US border at Gretna, Manitoba ended the year delivering 3.1 mmbpd. Refinery demand in the upper Midwest PADD II market has been strong given the economic recovery and enhanced mobility demand. On the US Gulf Coast, lower supply of heavy crude from Latin America and the Middle East is driving increased demand for Canadian heavy crude.Global crude oil demand in most base case forecasts is expected to grow into the next decade, primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), such as India and China. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to moderate over time due to vehicle fuel efficiency improvement and increasing sales of electric vehicles.New supply to meet this growing demand is expected to primarily come from Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries and North America. Growth in supply from OPEC is anticipated to be led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with their significant low cost reserves and could be supplemented by the return of sanctioned Iranian production. Growth in North America is expected to be driven by the Permian Basin which is a large and cost competitive light crude oil resource base. In addition, heavy crude oil growth is expected from the WCSB as additional egress availability will support expansion of existing projects and some potential new greenfield facilities.The anticipated combination of long-term demand growth in non-OECD nations, domestic demand contraction over time, and continued production growth in the Permian Basin and WCSB highlights the importance of our strategic asset footprint and reinforces the need for additional export oriented infrastructure. We believe that we are well positioned to meet these evolving supply and demand fundamentals through expansion of system capacity for incremental access to the US Gulf Coast, and through further development of our new EIEC in Corpus Christi, the largest crude oil export facility in North America.Opposition to fossil fuel development in conjunction with evolving consumer preferences and new technology could underpin accelerated energy transition scenarios impacting long-term supply and demand of crude oil. We continue to closely monitor the evolution of all of these factors to be able to pro-actively adapt our business to help meet our customers’ and society’s energy needs.19GAS TRANSMISSION AND MIDSTREAMGas Transmission and Midstream consists of our investments in natural gas pipelines and gathering and processing facilities in Canada and the US, including US Gas Transmission, Canadian Gas Transmission, US Midstream and other assets.20US GAS TRANSMISSIONUS Gas Transmission includes ownership interests in Texas Eastern Transmission, L.P.

SESH extends to Alabama, interconnecting with 14 major north-south pipelines and three high-deliverability storage facilities and has a peak day capacity of 1.1 bcf/d of natural gas. We have a 50% interest in SESH.Vector is an approximately 560 kilometer (348 mile) pipeline travelling between Joliet, Illinois in the Chicago area and Ontario. Vector can deliver 1.745 bcf/d of natural gas, of which 455 million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d) is leased to NEXUS. We have a 60% interest in Vector.Transmission and storage services are generally provided under firm agreements where customers reserve capacity in pipelines and storage facilities. The vast majority of these agreements provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of the actual volumes transported on the pipelines, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported, injected or withdrawn, which is intended to recover variable costs.Interruptible transmission and storage services are also available where customers can use capacity if it exists at the time of the request and are generally at a higher toll than long-term contracted rates. Interruptible revenues depend on the amount of volumes transported or stored and the associated rates for this service. Storage operations also provide a variety of other value-added services including natural gas parking, loaning and balancing services to meet customers’ needs.CANADIAN GAS TRANSMISSIONCanadian Gas Transmission is comprised of Westcoast Energy Inc.’s (Westcoast) British Columbia (BC) Pipeline, Alliance Pipeline and other minor midstream gas gathering pipelines.BC Pipeline provides natural gas transmission services, transporting processed natural gas from facilities located primarily in northeastern BC to markets in BC and the US Pacific Northwest. It has a peak day capacity of 3.6 bcf/d of natural gas on approximately 2,950 kilometers (1,833 miles) of transmission pipeline in BC and Alberta, as well as associated mainline compressor stations. BC Pipeline is regulated by the CER under cost-of-service regulation.Alliance Pipeline is an approximately 3,000 kilometer (1,864 mile) integrated, high-pressure natural gas transmission pipeline with approximately 860 kilometers (534 miles) of lateral pipelines and related infrastructure. It transports liquids-rich natural gas from northeast BC, northwest Alberta and the Bakken area in North Dakota to the Alliance Chicago gas exchange hub downstream of the Aux Sable Liquid Products LP natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction and fractionation plant at Channahon, Illinois. The system has a peak day capacity of 1.8 bcf/d of natural gas. We have a 50% interest in Alliance Pipeline.The majority of transportation services provided by Canadian Gas Transmission are under firm agreements, which provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of actual volumes transported on the pipeline, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported to recover variable costs. Canadian Gas Transmission also provides interruptible transmission services where customers can use capacity if it is available at the time of request. Payments under these services are based on volumes transported.22US MIDSTREAMUS Midstream includes a 42.7% interest in each of Aux Sable Liquid Products LP and Aux Sable Midstream LLC, and a 50% interest in Aux Sable Canada LP (collectively, Aux Sable). Aux Sable Liquid Products LP owns and operates a NGL extraction and fractionation plant at Channahon, Illinois, outside Chicago, near the terminus of Alliance Pipeline. Aux Sable also owns facilities connected to Alliance Pipeline that facilitate delivery of liquids-rich natural gas for processing at the Aux Sable plant. These facilities include the Palermo Conditioning Plant and the Prairie Rose Pipeline in the Bakken area of North Dakota, owned and operated by Aux Sable Midstream US, and Aux Sable Canada’s interests in the Montney area of BC, comprising the Septimus Pipeline. Aux Sable Canada also owns a facility which processes refinery/upgrader offgas in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.As of August 17, 2022, US Midstream also includes a 13.2% effective economic interest in DCP Midstream, LP (DCP). Prior to August 17, 2022, we had a 28.3% effective economic interest in DCP. DCP is a master limited partnership, with a diversified portfolio of assets, engaged in the business of gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing and selling natural gas; producing, fractionating, transporting, storing and selling NGL; and recovering and selling condensate. DCP owns and operates more than 36 plants and approximately 86,905 kilometers (54,000 miles) of natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, with operations in nine states across major producing regions.OTHEROther consists primarily of our offshore assets. Enbridge Offshore Pipelines is comprised of 11 natural gas gathering and FERC regulated transmission pipelines and four oil pipelines. These pipelines are located in four major corridors in the Gulf of Mexico, extending to deepwater developments, and include almost 2,100 kilometers (1,300 miles) of underwater pipe and onshore facilities with total capacity of approximately 6.5 bcf/d.COMPETITIONOur natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, nuclear and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.Competition exists in all markets that our businesses serve. Competitors include interstate/interprovincial and intrastate/intraprovincial pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGL. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies.SUPPLY AND DEMANDOur gas transmission assets make up one of the largest natural gas transportation networks in North America, driving connectivity between prolific supply basins and major demand centers within the continent. Our systems have been integral to the transition in supply and demand markets over the last decade, and we expect to continue to play a part as the energy landscape evolves.23Natural gas production in the Appalachian and Permian basins has grown dramatically in the past decade. Today, these regions produce more than 47 bcf/d of natural gas on a combined basis. Improved technology and increased shale gas drilling have increased the supply of low-cost natural gas. As well, there has been, and continues to be, a corresponding increase in demand for our natural gas infrastructure in North America. Through a series of expansions and reversals on our core systems, combined with the execution of greenfield projects and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to meet the needs of both producers and consumers. Our US Gas Transmission systems were initially designed to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast to the supply-constrained northeast markets. Our asset base now has the capability to transport diverse bi-directional supply to the northeast, southeast, Midwest, Gulf Coast and LNG markets on a fully subscribed and highly utilized basis.The northeast market continues its role as a predominantly supply constrained region with steady demand. The bi-directional capabilities offered by our US Gas Transmission system allow us to deliver in an efficient manner to our regional customers. The region has seen an increase in natural gas supply due to the development of the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachia region.The southeast market is linked to multiple, highly liquid supply pools that include the Marcellus and Utica shale developments, offering consistent supply and stable pricing to a growing population of end-use customers across our multiple systems under long-term, utility-like arrangements.With connectivity to Appalachian and western Canadian supply through our systems, the Midwest market has access to two of the lowest cost gas producing regions on the continent. As demand in the region is expected to continue to grow by over 2.0 bcf/d over the next decade, maintaining this link will remain important. Flexibility in supply for this market is especially critical to maintaining liquidity and price stability as natural gas continues to replace coal-fired generation.Gulf Coast demand growth is being driven by an increase in the volume of LNG exports, an ongoing wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities, along with power generation and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Demand in these markets in the region is anticipated to grow by more than 20.0 bcf/d through 2040. The Gulf Coast market has been the beneficiary of low-cost capacity on our assets as the relationship between supply and market centers has shifted. Such cost-effective capacity is difficult to access or replicate, offering existing shippers and transporters stability of capacity and utilization. Tide-water market access and proximity to Mexico continue to make this region a platform of global trade as pipeline and LNG exports continue their growth trajectory. In 2022, the US exported over 10.6 bcf/d of natural gas to LNG markets, primarily from the Gulf Coast region.Western Canada, not unlike other supply hubs, is a source of low-cost supply seeking access to premium markets in North America and globally. One of the few vital links to demand centers in the Pacific Northwest are our own systems in the region, which are highly utilized. The continental supply profile has shifted to natural gas shale plays such as the Montney and Duvernay within western Canada. These supply shifts have shaped our growth strategies and affect the nature of the projects anticipated in the capital expenditures discussed below in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 24% by 2050, according to the recently released International Energy Agency’s Stated Policy Scenario, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. According to the Stated Policy Scenario, natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand, and gas consumption is anticipated to grow by approximately 13% during this period as one of the world’s most significant energy sources. North American exports are expected to play a significant part in meeting global demand, underscoring the ability of our assets to remain highly utilized by shippers, and highlighting the need for incremental transportation solutions across North America, as well as further build-out of export facilities to meet international demand.24The long-term impacts of the Ukraine conflict on global gas markets are still unclear. Europe has experienced a rapid increase in natural gas prices, largely as a result of reduced natural gas supply from Russia. Global LNG markets have responded, and natural gas storage volumes entering the winter season in Europe were strong. However, these LNG cargos have largely been diverted from Asian markets, and over time the LNG market is expected to normalize.Europe continues to seek lower-carbon gas supplies and has accelerated plans to develop hydrogen as an alternative to natural gas. The global hydrogen market is still relatively immature, but with incentives being put in place such as those in the US Inflation Reduction Act, hydrogen production at large scale is becoming increasingly commercialized, which has led to a growing export market. Given its proximity to low-cost natural gas supplies and suitable geologic storage for carbon dioxide (CO2), the US Gulf Coast is well positioned to be a leading export hub to supply blue hydrogen to international markets. Given these rapidly changing global fundamentals, and coupled with growing appetite for lower-carbon hydrogen, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to shippers and meet both regional and international demand.Opposition to natural gas development, including new pipeline projects, has been increasing in recent years. This may challenge continued growth of the North American gas market and the ability to efficiently connect supply and demand. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investments in Canadian and US gas transportation facilities. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGEGas Distribution and Storage consists of our natural gas utility operations, the core of which is Enbridge Gas Inc. (Enbridge Gas), which serves residential, commercial and industrial customers throughout Ontario. This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Québec.25ENBRIDGE GAS Enbridge Gas is a rate-regulated natural gas distribution utility with storage and transmission services. Enbridge Gas' distribution system, supported by storage and compression assets, carries natural gas from the point of local supply to customers and serves residential, commercial and industrial customers across Ontario.There are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which Enbridge Gas is directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage.DistributionEnbridge Gas’ principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis, without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract. The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts. Under a firm contract, Enbridge Gas is obligated to deliver natural gas to the customer up to a maximum daily volume. The service provided under an interruptible contract is similar to that of a firm contract, except that it allows for service interruption at Enbridge Gas’ option primarily to meet seasonal or peak demands. The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) approves rates for both contract and general services. The distribution system consists of approximately 149,000 kilometers (92,584 miles) of pipelines that carry natural gas from the point of local supply to customers.Customers have a choice with respect to natural gas supply. Customers may purchase and deliver their own natural gas to points upstream of the distribution system or directly into Enbridge Gas’ distribution system, or, alternatively, they may choose a system supply option, whereby customers purchase natural gas from Enbridge Gas’ supply portfolio. To acquire the necessary volume of natural gas to serve its customers, Enbridge Gas maintains a diversified natural gas supply portfolio, acquiring supplies on a delivered basis in Ontario, as well as acquiring supply from multiple supply basins across North America.TransportationEnbridge Gas contracts for firm transportation service, primarily with TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TransCanada), Vector and NEXUS, to meet its annual natural gas supply requirements. The transportation service contracts are not directly linked with any particular source of natural gas supply. Separating transportation contracts from natural gas supply allows Enbridge Gas flexibility in obtaining its own natural gas supply and accommodating the requests of its direct purchase customers for assignment of TransCanada capacity. Enbridge Gas forecasts the natural gas supply needs of its customers, including the associated transportation and storage requirements.In addition to contracting for transportation service, Enbridge Gas offers firm and interruptible transportation services on its own Dawn-Parkway pipeline system. Enbridge Gas’ transmission system consists of approximately 5,500 kilometers (3,418 miles) of high pressure pipeline and five mainline compressor stations and has an effective peak daily demand capacity of 7.6 bcf/d. Enbridge Gas’ transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at the Tecumseh Gas Storage facility and Dawn Hub (collectively, Dawn) to major Canadian and US markets, and forms an important link in moving natural gas from western Canada and US supply basins to central Canadian and northeastern US markets.As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario has continued to grow, there has been increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern US. Enbridge Gas delivered 2,162 bcf of gas through its distribution and transmission system in 2022. A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas’ transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately 15 years and the longest remaining contract term being 18 years.26StorageEnbridge Gas’ business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits Enbridge Gas to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off-peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice permits Enbridge Gas to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing its overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to Enbridge Gas’ franchise areas.Enbridge Gas’ storage facility at Dawn is located in southwestern Ontario, and has a total working capacity of approximately 284 bcf in 34 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. Dawn is the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada and one of the largest in North America. Approximately 180 bcf of the total working capacity is available to Enbridge Gas for utility operations. Enbridge Gas also has storage contracts with third parties for 21 bcf of storage capacity.Dawn offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canadian and US supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeast US. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. During 2022, Dawn provided services such as storage, balancing, gas loans, transport, exchange and peaking services to over 200 counterparties.A substantial amount of Enbridge Gas’ storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately four years and the longest remaining contract term being 14 years.GAZIFÈREWe wholly own Gazifère, a natural gas distribution company that serves approximately 44,000 customers in western Québec. Gazifère is regulated by the Québec Régie de l’énergie.COMPETITIONEnbridge Gas’ distribution system is regulated by the OEB and is subject to regulation in a number of areas, including rates. Enbridge Gas is not generally subject to third-party distribution competition within its franchise areas.Enbridge Gas competes with other forms of energy available to its customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include weather, price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation including the federal carbon pricing law, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and other factors.SUPPLY AND DEMANDWe anticipate that demand for natural gas in North America will stabilize over the long term with continued growth in peak day demands, however, there are risks to the natural gas market that may challenge its growth prospects. Net-zero carbon policies, evolving customer preferences for lower-carbon fuels and more efficient technologies, combined with increasing opposition to natural gas development in North America, may reduce the markets’ ability to efficiently deploy capital to connect supply and demand. We monitor these factors closely to be able to develop our business strategy to align with shifts in customer preferences and public policy requirements.27We expect demand for natural gas connections in Ontario to maintain its recent growth profile due to continued population growth and with competitively priced natural gas expected to continue to provide a strong price advantage relative to alternate energy options, even with increasing carbon charges. Specific interest in natural gas connections is expected to come from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas in Ontario.Enbridge Gas continues to focus on promoting conservation and energy efficiency by undertaking activities focused on reducing natural gas consumption through various demand side management programs offered across all markets and sourcing supply with a smaller carbon footprint. In addition to our existing and proposed RNG programs, we are also expanding our efforts to source other lower-carbon supplies, such as responsibly sourced natural gas, and H2.The storage and transportation marketplace continues to respond to changing natural gas supply dynamics, including a recovered supply environment which was negatively impacted by the global pandemic.Over the past decade, growth in the North American gas supply landscape, driven mainly by the development of unconventional gas resources in the Montney, Permian, Marcellus and Utica supply basins, has resulted in lower annual commodity prices and narrower seasonal price spreads. However, over the past year, geopolitical unrest has increased and lead to elevated concerns with energy security in regions such as Europe and Asia. In response, one of the key supply sources supporting global energy security has been US LNG, which has introduced additional competition for North American supply. These market dynamics have resulted in higher and more volatile natural gas prices across many US and Canadian natural gas trading points. Unregulated storage values are primarily determined by the difference in value between winter and summer natural gas prices. Despite the recent volatility exhibited in natural gas prices, storage values have been relatively stable.28RENEWABLE POWER GENERATIONRenewable Power Generation consists primarily of investments in wind and solar assets, as well as geothermal, waste heat recovery, and transmission assets. In North America, assets are primarily located in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Québec, and in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia. We are also developing several solar self-power projects along our oil and gas rights-of-way in North America. In Europe, we hold equity interests in operating offshore wind facilities in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, as well as interests in several offshore wind projects under construction and active development in France and the United Kingdom.29Combined Renewable Power Generation investments represent approximately 2,175 MW of net generation capacity, which primarily consists of approximately:•1,389 MW generated by North American wind facilities;•377 MW generated by European offshore wind facilities;•187 MW to be generated by the Fécamp and Calvados Offshore Wind projects in France, both of which are currently under construction;•6 MW to be generated by the Provence Grand Large Floating Offshore Wind project in France, which is under construction; and•93 MW generated by North American solar facilities in operation, with an additional 97 MW in projects in pre-construction and under construction.The vast majority of the power produced from these facilities is sold under long-term PPAs.In September 2022, we acquired renewable energy project developer TGE with a development portfolio of wind, solar, and energy storage projects in Texas, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming. TGE’s development portfolio includes 3.9 GW of conditionally sold renewable generation projects and an additional 3 GW of wholly-owned projects in development. Following its acquisition of TGE, Enbridge became one of the top 15 renewable energy project developers in the US.Renewable Power Generation also includes our 25% interest in the East-West Tie, a 450-MW transmission line in northwestern Ontario, which entered operations in March 2022.JOINT VENTURES / EQUITY INVESTMENTSThe investments in the Canadian wind and solar assets (excluding self-power) and two of the US renewable assets are held within a joint venture in which we maintain a 51% interest and which we manage and operate.We also own interests in European offshore wind facilities through the following joint ventures:•a 24.9% interest in Rampion Offshore Wind, located in the United Kingdom;•a 25.4% interest in Hohe See and Albatros Offshore Wind, located in Germany;•a 25.5% interest in the Saint-Nazaire Offshore Wind project, located in France;•a 25% interest in the Provence Grande Large Floating Offshore Wind project, under construction in France;•a 17.9% interest in the Fécamp Offshore Wind project, under construction in France; and•a 21.7% interest in the Calvados Offshore Wind project, under construction in France.COMPETITIONRenewable Power Generation operates in the North American and European power markets, which are subject to competition and supply and demand fundamentals for power in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The majority of revenue is generated pursuant to long-term PPAs (or has been substantially hedged). As such, the financial performance is not significantly impacted by fluctuating power prices arising from supply/demand imbalances or the actions of competing facilities during the term of the applicable contracts. However, the renewable energy sector includes large utilities, small independent power producers and private equity investors, which are expected to aggressively compete for new project development opportunities and for the right to supply customers when contracts expire.To grow in an environment of heightened competition, we strategically seek opportunities to collaborate with well-established renewable power developers and financial partners and to target regions with commercial constructs consistent with our low risk business model. In addition, we have expertise in completing and delivering large scale infrastructure projects.30SUPPLY AND DEMANDRenewable power generation in North America and Europe is expected to grow significantly over the next 20 years due to the replacement of older fossil fuel-based sources of electricity generation in support of announced governmental carbon emissions reduction targets. Any additional governmental actions toward reducing emissions and/or increasing electrification will further accelerate renewable electricity demand growth and electrification across all sectors.On the demand side, North American economic growth over the longer term and the continued electrification and transition to lower-carbon strategies within the residential, transportation and industrial sectors are expected to drive growing electricity demand. Furthermore, voluntary GHG emissions reduction targets are becoming increasingly expected by stakeholders, which is driving significant demand from corporate electricity end-users for clean electricity and environmental attributes. However, continued efficiency gains are expected to make the economy less energy-intensive and temper overall demand growth.On the supply side in North America, legislation is accelerating the retirement of aging coal-fired generation, while generation from conventional nuclear power is also forecast to decline. As a result, North America requires significant new generation capacity from preferred technologies. Gas-fired and renewable energy facilities, including solar and wind (which make up the bulk of our renewable power assets), are generally the preferred sources to replace coal-fired generation due to their lower-carbon intensities. Governments are also proposing tax incentives to support low-emission and renewable energy generation resource development.The falling capital and operating costs of wind and solar, combined with their improving capacity factors, are expected to continue the ongoing trend of making renewable energy more competitive and support investment over the long-term, regardless of available government incentives. Generation from renewable sources is expected to double over the next two decades in North America. Aside from the construction of new wind and solar facilities, other growth opportunities include repowering projects to increase output from, and extending the project-life of, our existing facilities.In Europe, the renewable energy outlook is robust. Demand for electricity is expected to gradually increase over the next two decades, driven by electrification of transportation and buildings, and the desire to reduce reliance on gas sourced from Russia. Energy efficiency gains are expected to temper, but not eliminate, demand growth. Renewable power is expected to play a significant role in Europe’s ability to meet its aggressive lower-carbon and renewable energy targets.On the supply side, the International Energy Agency expects coal to fall by more than 90% from 2020 levels, while nuclear is expected to fall by one-third, by 2040. Over the same period, it anticipates power generation from renewable sources will more than double, including installed (onshore and offshore) wind more than doubling and photovoltaics solar power nearly tripling. We, through our European joint ventures, continue to invest in offshore wind projects in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and to explore opportunities, to meet the growing demand.ENERGY SERVICESThe Energy Services businesses in Canada and the US provide physical commodity marketing and logistical services to North American refiners, producers, and other customers.Energy Services is primarily focused on servicing customers across the value chain and capturing value from quality, time, and location price differentials when opportunities arise. To execute these strategies, Energy Services transports and stores on both Enbridge-owned and third party assets using a combination of contracted long-term and short-term pipeline, storage, railcar, and truck capacity agreements.31COMPETITIONEnergy Services’ earnings are primarily generated from arbitrage opportunities which, by their nature, can be replicated by competitors. An increase in market participants entering into similar arbitrage strategies could have an impact on our earnings. Efforts to mitigate competition risk include diversification of the marketing business by transacting at the majority of major hubs in North America and establishing long-term relationships with clients and pipelines.ELIMINATIONS AND OTHEREliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs that are not allocated to business segments, the impact of foreign exchange hedge settlements and the activities of our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries. The principal activity of our captive insurance subsidiaries is providing insurance and reinsurance coverage for certain insurable property and casualty risk exposures of our operating subsidiaries and certain equity investments. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and corporate investments.REGULATIONGOVERNMENT REGULATIONPipeline RegulationOur Liquids Pipelines and Gas Transmission and Midstream assets are subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs.In the US, our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an agency within the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines. These laws and regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines and to operate them within permissible pressures.PHMSA continues to review existing regulations and establish new regulations to support safety standards that are designed to improve operations integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will result in additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failure or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows, financial condition and competitive advantage.Our ability to establish transportation and storage rates on our US interstate natural gas facilities is subject to regulation by the FERC, whose rulings and policies could have an adverse impact on the ability to recover the full cost of operating these pipeline and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return. Regulatory or administrative actions by FERC such as rate proceedings, applications to certify construction of new facilities, and depreciation and amortization policies can affect our business, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues and increasing our costs of doing business.32In Canada, our pipelines are subject to safety regulations administered by the CER or provincial regulators. Applicable legislation and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. Among other obligations, this regulatory framework imposes requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines.As in the US, laws and regulations addressing pipeline safety in Canada were enacted over the past few years. The changes demonstrate an increased focus on the implementation of management systems to address key areas, such as emergency management, integrity management, safety, security and environmental protection. The CER also has authority to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance with the regulatory regime it administers, as well as to impose financial requirements for future abandonment and major pipeline releases.A key component of pipeline safety and reliability is the approach to integrity management that uses reliability targets and safety case assessments. A long history of extensive inline inspection has provided detailed knowledge of the assets in our pipeline systems. Our pipelines are assessed and maintained in a proactive manner ensuring reliability targets are met. Furthermore, the integrity management program has an independent step to check the results of integrity assessments to validate the effectiveness of the program and to ensure that the operational risk remains as low as reasonably practicable throughout the integrity inspection and assessment cycle. As inspection technology, pipeline materials and construction practices improve with time, and new data on threats and pipeline condition are gathered, our methods of maintaining fitness for service evolves, with a strong focus on continual improvement in every aspect of integrity management.Our pipelines also face economic regulatory risk. Broadly defined, economic regulatory risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies reject proposed commercial arrangements, applications or policies, upon which future and current operations are dependent. Our pipelines are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the CER and the FERC, with respect to the tariffs and tolls. The rejection of applications for approval of new tariff structures or proposed commercial arrangements and changes in interpretation of existing regulations by courts or regulators could have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings.Gas Distribution and StorageOur gas distribution and storage utility operations are regulated by the OEB and the Québec Régie de l’énergie, among others. To the extent that the regulators’ future actions are different from current expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or refund of amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or amounts that would have been recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in the absence of the effects of regulation, could be different from the amounts that are eventually recovered or refunded.Enbridge Gas' distribution rates, commencing in 2019, are set under a five-year incentive regulation (IR) framework using a price cap mechanism. The price cap mechanism establishes new rates each year through an annual base rate escalation at inflation less a 0.3% productivity factor, annual updates for certain costs to be passed through to customers, and where applicable, the recovery of material discrete incremental capital investments beyond those that can be funded through base rates. The IR framework includes the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts, as well as an earnings sharing mechanism that requires Enbridge Gas to share equally with customers any earnings in excess of 150 basis points over the annual OEB approved return on equity (ROE).33In October 2022, Enbridge Gas filed its application with the OEB to establish a 2024 through 2028 rate setting framework. The application and framework seek approval to establish 2024 base rates on a cost-of-service basis and to establish a price cap IR rate setting mechanism to be used for the remainder of the term (2025 - 2028). The OEB has determined it will hear the application in two phases, with Phase 1 addressing items that affect rates effective January 1, 2024, and Phase 2 addressing items that will affect rates subsequent to January 1, 2024. An OEB decision is expected on Phase 1 of the application in the second half of 2023. Enbridge Gas continues to develop opportunities to support a lower-carbon future in Ontario. In 2021, we received OEB approval of an Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) framework and integrated the framework into our planning practices. The framework requires Enbridge Gas to consider facility and non-pipe demand and/or supply side alternatives (IRP alternatives) to address the systems needs of its regulated operations, where certain parameters have been met. The framework also allows Enbridge Gas to pursue an IRP alternative (or combination of IRP alternatives and facility alternative) where it is found to be in the best interests of Enbridge Gas and its customers, taking into account reliability and safety, cost-effectiveness, public policy, optimized scoping, and risk management. Enbridge Gas has reviewed its system needs as part of its 2023-2032 Asset Management Plan and is now evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of IRP alternatives for the projects. A summary of the IRP evaluation statuses has been filed as part of Enbridge Gas’ 2024 Rebasing Application.Renewable Power GenerationRenewable Power Generation is subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs.The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) is an international regulatory authority responsible for establishing and enforcing reliability standards to reduce risks to the reliability and security of the grid in Canada, the US, and Mexico. It is subject to oversight from the FERC in the US and provincial governments in Canada. The FERC has authority over many markets in the US and is tasked with ensuring safe, reliable, and secure interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. This includes establishing reliability standards and determining certain pricing aspects of transmission development and access, among others. NERC and FERC standards and pricing decisions are also updated from time to time and could impact our operations, capital expenditures, earnings, and cash flows, though some of these impacts could be positive for our business.At the US federal level, our Renewable Power Generation assets are subject to legislation overseen by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which is aimed at reducing the impact of development and human activity on wildlife, along with other federal environmental permitting legislation. These federal environmental laws are subject to change from time to time which could require Enbridge to obtain new permits, update practices, or amend operations and operating expenditures.In Canada, the Federal Government does not generally regulate the electricity sector though it has imposed a federal carbon price on other sectors via its output-based pricing system (OBPS) and has proposed a Clean Electricity Regulation (CE Regulation) that would require Canada’s electricity grid reach net-zero by 2035. The CE Regulation is expected to come into effect in 2023.Policy changes may also provide new opportunities for existing assets and new developments. The United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act in late 2022, which established long-term production and investment tax credits for renewable power generation, battery storage projects and for related manufacturing supply chains. Similarly, Canada proposed in its Fall Economic Statement competitive tax credits for renewable power generation and battery storage projects, which it anticipates passing in 2023. Changes to these tax programs could impact development plans.34Renewable Power Generation is also subject to Provincial and State regulations governing the energy resource mix on the grid, emissions levels of the electricity grid, and market regulations related to emergency operations, extreme weather preparedness, and market participation, among others. These regulations may change from time to time, which could impact Enbridge’s operations and increase the costs of participating in regional electricity markets.Our Renewable Power Generation assets in France and Germany each have federal policies in place and are subject to directives and regulations established and enforced by the European Union (EU). These include the Renewable Energy Directive (most recently, RED II passed set targets through 2030), the European Green Deal, and ongoing work on financing mechanisms and transmission directives and programs. The EU is also responsible for establishing environmental protection rules and permitting standards. During 2022, member states of the EU introduced extraordinary and temporary measures to address high energy prices including caps and demand reduction goals. As the minimum PPA prices in Germany and France will still be honored, there will not be any negative implications to our PPA prices. The federal policies and regulations in place are subject to change from time to time, which could impact our operations and related expenditures; however, the EU’s general direction is to facilitate increased renewable power integration to its grid.The United Kingdom (UK) government is responsible for establishing renewable energy and carbon pricing policies for the entire UK, as well as long-term electricity sector planning and procurement mechanisms and structure for auctions that are administered at the national level, e.g., England, Scotland, within the UK. Each country within the UK is also responsible for establishing its own environmental and permitting regulations. This process is still ongoing following Brexit and in some cases continues to result in more volatile merchant power prices; however, expanded interconnectors to Europe and policies aimed at increasing domestic renewable capacity are in progress. Government-imposed temporary price controls, effective January 1, 2023, were introduced during 2022 to address the significant increase in energy prices. The impact of merchant exposure on our Renewable Power Generation asset in the UK is limited by fixed revenue payments backed by the UK government.Energy ServicesEnergy Services is regulated by government authorities in the areas of commodity trading, import and export compliance and the transportation of commodities. Non-compliance with governing rules and regulations could result in fines, penalties and operating restrictions. These consequences would have an adverse effect on operations, earnings, cash flows, financial condition and competitive advantage. Energy Services retains dedicated professional staff and has a robust regulatory compliance program (including targeted training) to mitigate these potential risks associated with the business.In the US, commodity marketing is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission, the various commodity exchanges, the US Department of Justice and state regulators. The provincial and territorial securities regulators similarly regulate commodity marketing within Canada and are members of the Canadian Securities Administrators. These various regulators enforce, among other things, the prohibition of market manipulation, fraud and disruptive trading.The export of natural gas out of Alberta is regulated by the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). The import and export of commodities between Canada and the US is subject to regulation by the CER and the US Department of Energy, as well as customs authorities. In particular, import and export permits are required, with associated regular reporting requirements. Breaches of import and export rules and permits could result in an inability to perform day to day operations, and therein negatively impact the earnings of the business.35The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids by railcar or truck is regulated by the US DOT, Transport Canada and provincial regulation. Each jurisdiction requires compliance with security, safety, emergency management, and environmental laws and regulations related to ground transportation of commodities. Risks associated with transportation of crude or natural gas liquids include unplanned releases. In the event of a release, remediation of the affected area would be required. Energy Services engages third parties, such as Emergency Response Assistance Canada, the Chemical Transportation Emergency Center and the Canadian Transport Emergency Center to assist in such remediation.ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONPipeline RegulationOur Liquids Pipelines and Gas Transmission and Midstream assets are subject to numerous federal, state and provincial environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, water discharge and waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits and other approvals.In particular, in the US, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance. Some states in which we operate are establishing new state implementation plans which have new emissions limits to comply with ozone standards regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, the ozone standards were lowered once again from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb, which may require states to implement additional emissions regulations. The precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes. In addition, compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs may significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels.In the US, climate change action is evolving at federal, state and regional levels. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2007 established that GHG emissions were pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to federal regulations, we are currently subject to an obligation to report our GHG emissions at our largest emitting facilities but are not generally subject to limits on emissions of GHGs. The current US presidential administration has also announced that policies designed to combat climate change and reduce GHG emissions will be a key legislative and regulatory priority, and thus stricter emissions limits and air quality enforcement actions are likely. In addition, a number of states have joined regional GHG initiatives, and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in GHG emissions. Public interest groups and regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on the emission of methane associated with natural gas development and transmission as a source of GHG emissions. However, as the key details of future GHG restrictions and compliance mechanisms remain undefined, the likely future effects on our business are uncertain.Canada has adopted a pan-Canadian approach to pricing carbon emissions to incent GHG emission reductions across all sectors of the economy. This approach was adopted in 2016 and entails both a consumer price on carbon, and an intensity-based system for industry which addresses competitiveness and carbon leakage. Provinces and territories may implement their own system of carbon pricing provided it meets the federal benchmark (and if they fail to do so the federal system will be imposed on them). In March 2022, Canada published its 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) which builds on the Pan-Canadian Framework, and Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, and details the roadmap for Canada to meet its domestic climate target of a 40-45% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and attaining net-zero emissions by 2050. The ERP details the complementary policies and programs that Canada will enact to enable it to meet its domestic climate goal. Effective January 1, 2023, the federal carbon price was increased from $50 to $65 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). This will increase by $15 per tonne and rise to $170 per tCO2e in 2030.36Gas Distribution and StorageOur Gas Distribution and Storage operations, facilities and workers are subject to municipal, provincial and federal legislation which regulates the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers. Environmental legislation primarily includes regulation of spills and emissions to air, land and water; hazardous waste management; the assessment and management of excess soil and contaminated sites; protection of environmentally sensitive areas, and species at risk and their habitats; and the reporting and reduction of GHG emissions.Gas distribution system operation, as with any industrial operation, has the potential risk of abnormal or emergency conditions, or other unplanned events that could result in releases or emissions exceeding permitted levels. These events could result in injuries to workers or the public, adverse impacts to the environment, property damage and/or regulatory infractions including orders and fines. We could also incur future liability for soil and groundwater contamination associated with past and present site activities.In addition to gas distribution, we also operate gas storage facilities and a small volume of oil and brine production in southwestern Ontario. Environmental risk associated with these facilities has the potential for unplanned releases. In the event of a release, remediation of the affected area would be required. There would also be potential for fines and orders under environmental legislation, and potential third-party liability claims by any affected landowners.The gas distribution system and our other operations must maintain environmental approvals and permits from regulators to operate. As a result, these assets and facilities are subject to periodic inspections and/or audits. Reports are submitted to our regulators as required to demonstrate we are in good standing with our environmental requirements. Failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in operational interruptions, fines, and/or orders for additional pollution control technology or environmental mitigation.As environmental regulations continue to evolve and become more stringent, the cost to maintain compliance and the time required to obtain approvals continues to increase. A recent example includes the implementation of the new excess soil management requirements (Ontario Regulation 406/19) which has resulted in an increase in soil management costs and effort.As in previous years, in 2022, we reported operational GHG emissions, including emissions from stationary combustion, flaring, venting and fugitive sources to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, and a number of voluntary reporting programs. In accordance with the provincial GHG regulations, stationary combustion and flaring emissions related to storage and transmission operations were verified in detail by a third-party accredited verifier with no material discrepancies found.Enbridge Gas utilizes emissions data management processes and systems to help with the data capture and mandatory and voluntary reporting needs. Quantification methodologies and emission factors are updated in our systems as required. Enbridge Gas continues to work with industry associations to refine quantification methodologies and emissions factors, as well as best management practices to minimize emissions.In October 2018, the federal government confirmed that Ontario is subject to the federal government’s carbon pricing program, otherwise known as the Federal Carbon Pricing Backstop Program. This program consists of two components: a carbon charge levied on fossil fuels, including natural gas, and an OBPS.37The federal carbon charge took effect on April 1, 2019 at a rate of 3.91 cents/cubic meter (m3) of natural gas and is applicable to the majority of customers. Enbridge Gas is registered as a natural gas distributor with the Canada Revenue Agency and remits the federal carbon charge on a monthly basis. The charge increases annually on April 1 of each year by 1.96 cents/m3, rising to 9.79 cents/m3 in 2022. In December 2020, the federal government announced plans to increase the federal carbon price by $15 per tonne each year beginning in 2023, rising to $170 per tCO2e in 2030. Enbridge Gas estimates that this will equate to a federal carbon charge on natural gas of approximately 33.31 cents/m3 in 2030.The OBPS component came into effect in Ontario on January 1, 2019 and ended on December 31, 2021. Under OBPS, a registered facility has a compliance obligation for the portion of their emissions that exceeds their annual facility emissions limit, which is calculated based on the sector specific output-based standard and annual production. From 2019 to 2021, Enbridge Gas was registered with ECCC as an emitter in the OBPS program and has an annual compliance obligation associated with the combustion and flaring emissions from its natural gas pipeline transmission system. As a registered facility under OBPS, Enbridge Gas submitted an annual report along with the required verification report from an accredited third-party verifier who found no material misstatements. Enbridge Gas was required to remit payment for facility emissions that exceed its annual facility emissions limit by December of the year following a compliance period. In accordance with the regulations, Enbridge Gas made payment for the 2021 compliance obligation in December 2022.In September 2020, Ontario and the federal government announced that the federal government has accepted that Ontario’s Emission Performance Standards (EPS) will replace the federal OBPS for industrial facilities. In March 2021, the federal government announced that the federal OBPS would stand down in Ontario at the end of 2021 and Ontario would transition to the EPS effective January 1, 2022. In September 2021, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act was amended to remove Ontario as a covered province, enabling the EPS to take effect on January 1, 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, Enbridge Gas transitioned out of the federal OBPS to the provincial EPS. Enbridge Gas is registered with the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks as a covered facility under the EPS and has an annual compliance obligation for its facility-related stationary combustion and flaring emissions associated with its transmission and storage operations. Enbridge Gas must remit payment annually on the portion of emissions that exceed its total annual emissions limit. Payment is due the year following a compliance period and as such, Enbridge Gas will remit payment for its 2022 EPS compliance obligation in 2023.Enbridge Gas applies to the OEB annually through a Federal Carbon Pricing Program application for approval of just and reasonable rates effective April 1 each year for the Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. and Union rate zones, to recover the costs associated with the Federal Carbon Charge and EPS Regulation as a pass-through to customers.Renewable Power GenerationIn March 2022, the Federal Government of Canada released a white paper setting out its plans for caps on emissions on Canada’s electricity grid with the intention of reaching a net-zero grid by 2035. The government subsequently proposed a CE Regulation framework and provided technical details for the program, which would cap emissions from electricity generation sources at, or near zero tCO2e per megawatt hour. Details of related compliance payments and potential credit generation opportunities are under review and the CE Regulation is expected to come into effect in 2023. Enbridge’s Renewable Power Generation resources are substantially non-emitting.38HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCESWORKFORCE SIZE AND COMPOSITIONAs at December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,100 regular employees, including approximately 1,600 unionized employees across our North American operations. This total rises to just over 13,000 if temporary employees and contractors are included. We have a strong preference for direct employment relationships but where we have collectively bargained-for employees, we have mature working relationships with our labor unions and the parties have traditionally committed themselves to the achievement of renewal agreements without a work stoppage.SAFETYWe believe all injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are preventable. Our overall focus on employee and contractor safety, including through the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to result in strong performance compared against industry benchmarks and we are actively engaged in continuous improvement exercises as we pursue our goal of zero incidents.DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSIONIn 2020, we announced Enbridge’s ESG goals – including goals to increase representation of women, underrepresented ethnic and racial groups (including Indigenous peoples), people with disabilities and veterans – to ensure our workforce is reflective of the communities where we operate. In executing on our ESG strategy, we continue to track progress towards these representation goals in 2022. Consistent with our culture, we remain committed to open, two-way dialogue related to our goals, enhancing transparency and accountability for all stakeholders.Diversity Representation GoalsPRODUCTIVITY AND DEVELOPMENTWe continually invest in our people’s personal and professional development because we recognize their success is our success. Every year, employees are provided access to a range of development and re-skilling opportunities through a variety of channels, including: extensive catalog of self-directed learning (10,000+ external courses plus proprietary Enbridge University courses); on-the-job learning opportunities and rotational assignments; curated leadership development programs; educational reimbursement; and developmental relationships with mentors through our formal mentor-protégé matching program.39EXECUTIVE OFFICERSThe following table sets forth information regarding our executive officers as at February 10, 2023:NameAgePositionGregory L.

RISK FACTORSThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, financial results, market price or value of our securities. This list is not exhaustive, and we place no priority or likelihood based on order of presentation or grouping under sub-captions.RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGEClimate change risks could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results, and these effects could be material.Climate change is a systemic risk that presents both physical and transition risks to our organization. A summary of these risks is discussed below. Given the interconnected nature of climate impacts, we also discuss these risks within the context of other risks impacting Enbridge throughout Item 1A. Risk Factors.Climate change and its associated impacts may increase our exposure to, and magnitude of, other risks identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, reputation, access to and cost of capital or insurance, business plans or strategy may all be materially adversely impacted as a result of climate change and its associated impacts.PHYSICAL RISKSClimate-related physical risks as a result of changing and more extreme weather, can damage our assets and affect the safety and reliability of our operations and has had such impacts in the past. Climate-related physical risks may be acute or chronic. Acute physical risks are those that are event-driven, including increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heavy snowfall, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, fires, hurricanes, cyclones, tornados, tropical storms, ice storms, and extreme temperatures. Chronic physical risks are longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as long-term changes in precipitation patterns, or sustained higher temperatures, which may cause sea level rises or chronic heat waves.Our assets are exposed to potential damage or other negative impacts from these kinds of events, which could result in reduced revenue from business disruption or reduced capacity and may also lead to increased costs due to repairs and required adaptation measures. Such events may also result in loss of life or injury or damage to property and the environment. We have experienced operational interruptions and damage to our assets from such weather events in the past, and we expect to experience climate-related physical risks in the future, potentially with increasing frequency or severity.42TRANSITION RISKSTransition risks relate to the transition to a lower-emissions economy, which may increase our cost of operations, impact our business plans, and influence stakeholder decisions about our company, each of which could adversely impact our reputation, strategic plan, business, operations or financial results. These transition risks include:•Policy and legal risksForeign and domestic governments continue to evaluate and implement policy, legislation, and regulations regarding reduction of GHG emissions, adaptation to climate change, transition to a lower-carbon economy, and disclosure of climate-related matters. Such policies, laws and regulations vary at the federal, state, provincial and municipal levels in which Enbridge operates and are continually evolving. International multilateral agreements, the obligations adopted thereunder, increasing physical impacts of climate change, changing political and public opinion and legal challenges concerning the adequacy of climate-related policy brought against governments and corporations, among other factors, are expected to accelerate the implementation of these measures. Efforts to regulate or restrict GHG emissions could negatively impact demand for the products we transport. Significant expenditures and resources could be required in order to meet new regulatory requirements. In addition, there has been an increase in climate and disclosure-related litigation against governments as well as energy companies. There is no assurance that our company will not be impacted by such litigation.In addition, Enbridge is required to adhere to a number of implicit and explicit carbon-pricing mechanisms. Many jurisdictions in which we operate are either increasing the stringency of existing, or introducing new, legislation or public policy to address climate change and reduce GHG emissions. These mechanisms may present climate-related transition risk to our business strategy, impacting both commodity demand and the overall energy mix we deliver. Carbon pricing mechanisms may expose us to increased costs as well as increasing energy costs to our customers. Our operations are subject to both explicit carbon prices (i.e., in BC) and implicit carbon prices (i.e., Canadian federal OBPS). These requirements are evolving; in Canada, the federal government is considering options to cap and cut oil and gas sector GHG emissions, which may impact our business, including a new cap-and-trade system under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 or modification of the current carbon pricing approach under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act.•Technology risksOur success in executing our strategic plan, including adapting to the energy transition over time and attaining our GHG emissions reduction goals and targets, depends, in part, on technology (including technology still under development), innovation and continued diversification with renewable power and other lower-carbon energy infrastructure as well as modernization of our infrastructure to reduce GHG emissions. Achieving our GHG emissions reduction goals and targets could require significant capital expenditures and resources, with the potential that the costs required to achieve our goals and targets materially differ from our original estimates and expectations. Similarly, there is a risk that emissions reduction technology does not materialize as expected, making it more difficult to reduce emissions.•Market risksClimate change concerns, increase in demand for lower-carbon and zero-emissions energy, alternative and new energy sources and technologies, changing customer behavior and reduced energy consumption could impact the demand for our services or securities. The pace and scale of the transition to a lower-carbon economy may pose a risk if Enbridge diversifies either too quickly or too slowly. Similarly, uncertainty in market signals, such as abrupt and unexpected shifts in energy costs and demands, including due to climate change concerns, can impact revenue through reduced throughput volumes on our pipeline transportation systems. 43•Reputational risksWe have long been committed to strong ESG practices and performance, and in November 2020, we introduced a set of ESG goals to strengthen transparency and accountability. We have set GHG emissions reduction goals and one of our strategic priorities is to adapt to the energy transition over time. If we are not able to achieve our GHG emissions reduction goals, are not able to meet future climate, emissions or other reporting requirements of regulators, or are not able to meet or manage current and future expectations and issues important to investors or other stakeholders, including those related to climate change, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business, operations or financial results. •Disclosure risksFinally, we currently provide certain climate-related disclosures, and from time to time, we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments to reduce our GHG emissions. These disclosures and goals, and our progress towards these commitments, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. There can be no assurance that our current or future disclosures and goals, the pathways by which we plan to reach our goals, or the methodologies that we currently use to support our disclosures and progress towards our goals, will satisfy any new and evolving regulations and legal requirements or expectations of our stakeholders, and the costs of aligning our current disclosures and goals to any new legal requirements may be significant. Additionally, if we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our emissions reduction goals and commitments, we may be subject to reputational harm, regulatory action, or other legal action.Companies across all sectors and industries are facing changing expectations or increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their approach to ESG matters, including climate change and GHG emissions. Companies in the energy industry are experiencing stakeholder opposition to new infrastructure, as well as organized opposition to oil and natural gas extraction and shipment of oil and natural gas products.Our business is undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and the energy transition, which could impact our strategic plan, business, operations or financial results. Our success in executing our strategic plan, including adapting to the energy transition over time and attaining our GHG emissions reduction goals and targets depends, in part, on technology (including technology still under development), innovation and continued diversification with renewable power and other lower-carbon energy infrastructure, as well as modernization of our infrastructure to reduce GHG emissions, all of which could require significant capital expenditures and resources. Public policy relating to climate change can drive investment in lower-emissions technologies which could impact both the supply of and demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons transported on our pipelines.RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION OR CATASTROPHIC EVENTSOperation of complex energy infrastructure involves many hazards and risks that may adversely affect our business, financial results and the environment.These operational risks include adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, and lower than expected levels of operating capacity and efficiency. These operational risks could be catastrophic in nature. Operational risk is also intensified by climate change. Climate change presents physical risks that may affect the safety and reliability of our operations. These include acute physical risks, such as heavy snowfall, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, fires, hurricanes, cyclones, tornados, tropical storms, ice storms, and extreme temperatures, and chronic physical risks, such as long-term changes in precipitation patterns, or sustained higher temperatures.44Our assets and operations are exposed to potential damage or other negative impacts from these operational risks, which could result in reduced revenue from business disruption or reduced capacity and may also lead to increased costs due to repairs and required adaptation measures. Such events have led to, could in the future lead to, rupture or release of product from our pipeline systems and facilities, or loss of life or injury to people, which could result in substantial losses for which insurance may not be sufficient or available and for which we may bear part or all of the cost.An environmental incident is an event that may cause environmental harm and could lead to increased operating and insurance costs, thereby negatively impacting earnings. An environmental incident could have lasting reputational impacts and could impact our ability to work with various stakeholders. For pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas, including residential communities, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering locations, the level of damage resulting from these events could be greater.We have experienced such events in the past, including in 2010 on Lines 6A and 6B of the Lakehead System; in October 2018 at the BC Pipeline T-South system; in January 2019, August 2019 and May 2020 at the Texas Eastern Pipeline; impacts from the winter storm in February 2021 in Texas; and from wildfires in July 2021 and flooding in November 2021 in BC. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to operational risks and events. We expect to continue to experience climate-related physical risks, potentially with increasing frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that we will not experience catastrophic or other events in the future. In addition, we could be subject to litigation and significant fines and penalties from regulators in connection with any such events. A service interruption could have a significant impact on our operations, and negatively impact financial results, relationships with stakeholders and our reputation.A service interruption due to a major power disruption, curtailment of commodity supply, operational incident, security incident (cyber or physical), availability of gas supply or distribution or other reasons could have a significant impact on our operations and negatively impact financial results, relationships with stakeholders, our reputation or the safety of our end customers. Service interruptions that impact our crude oil and natural gas transportation services can negatively impact shippers’ operations and earnings as they are dependent on our services to move their product to market or fulfill their own contractual arrangements, and this has in the past and may again lead to claims against us. We have experienced, and may again experience, service interruptions, restrictions or other operational constraints, including in connection with the kinds of operational incidents referred to in the previous risk factor.Our operations involve safety risks to the public and to our workers and contractors.Several of our pipelines and distribution systems are operated in close proximity to populated areas and a major incident could result in injury or loss of life to members of the public. In addition, given the natural hazards inherent in our operations, our workers and contractors are subject to personal safety risks. A public safety incident or an injury or loss of life to our workers or contractors, which we have experienced in the past and, despite the precautions we take, may experience in the future, could result in reputational damage to us, material repair costs or increased operating and insurance costs.45Cyber attacks pose threats to our technology systems and could materially adversely affect our business, operations, reputation or financial results.Our business is dependent upon information systems and other digital technologies for controlling our plants, pipelines and other assets, processing transactions and summarizing and reporting results of operations. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of information is critical to our operations. A security breach of our network or systems, or the network or systems of our third-party vendors, could result in improper operation of our assets, potentially including delays in the delivery or availability of our customers’ products, contamination or degradation of the products we transport, store and distribute, damage to our facilities or those of our customers, or releases of hydrocarbon products for which we could be held liable, all of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, operations or financial results. Furthermore, we and some of our vendors collect and store sensitive data in the ordinary course of our business, including personal information of our employees and residential gas distribution customers as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders. Cybersecurity risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication of cyber attacks and data security breaches, as well as due to international and domestic political factors including geopolitical tensions, armed hostilities, war, civil unrest, sabotage and terrorism. Human error can also contribute to a cyber incident, and cyber attacks can be internal as well as external and occur at any point in our supply chain. Because of the critical nature of our infrastructure and our use of information systems and other digital technologies to control our assets, we face a heightened risk of cyber attacks. Cyber threat actors have attacked and threatened to attack energy infrastructure, and various government agencies have increasingly stressed that these attacks are targeting critical infrastructure, and are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. New cybersecurity legislation, regulations and orders have been recently implemented or proposed resulting in additional actual and anticipated regulatory oversight and compliance requirements, which will require significant internal and external resources. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business of potential future legislation, regulations or orders relating to cybersecurity.We have been, and expect to continue to be, the target of cyber-attacks against which we have deployed, and continue to deploy, security measures. Our information systems or those of our vendors or other service providers are expected to become the target of further cyber attacks or security breaches which could compromise our data and systems, affect our ability to correctly record, process and report transactions, result in the loss of information, or cause operational disruption or incidents. As a result of a cyber attack or security breach, we could also be liable under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, be subject to regulatory action, fines or penalties, incur additional costs for remediation, litigation, breach of contract or indemnity claims, or other costs, all of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, operations or financial results.In addition, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period without detection. Any investigation of a cyber attack or other security incident may be inherently unpredictable, and it would take time before the completion of any investigation and availability of full and reliable information. During such time, we may not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack or other security incident, and our remediation efforts may not be successful. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.46Furthermore, media reports about a cyber attack or other significant security incident affecting the Company, whether accurate or not, or, under certain circumstances, our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, law enforcement, other regulatory agencies or affected individuals following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or otherwise, could negatively impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, harm to our relationships with customers, partners, suppliers and other third parties, interruption to our management, remediation or increased protection costs, significant litigation or regulatory action, fines or penalties, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, operations, reputation or financial results.Pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect local and global economies and our business, operations or financial results.Disruptions caused by pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial results and forward-looking expectations. Governments' emergency measures to combat the spread could include restrictions on business activity and travel, as well as requirements to isolate or quarantine. The duration and magnitude of such impacts will depend on many factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. COVID-19 and government responses interrupted business activities and supply chains, disrupted travel, and contributed to significant volatility in the financial and commodity markets.Disruptions related to pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors.Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or acts of war, and other civil unrest or activism could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.Terrorist attacks and threats (which may take the form of cyber attacks), escalation of military activity, armed hostilities, war, sabotage, or civil unrest or activism may have significant effects on general economic conditions and may cause fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity, each of which could adversely affect our business. Future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the US or Canada, or military or trade disruptions may significantly affect our operations and those of our customers. Strategic critical infrastructure targets, such as energy-related assets, are at greater risk of cyber attack and may be at greater risk of other future attacks than other targets in the US and Canada. The Company’s infrastructure and projects under construction could be direct targets or indirect casualties of a cyber or physical attack. In addition, increased environmental activism against pipeline construction and operation could potentially result in work delays, reduced demand for our products and services, new legislation or public policy or increased stringency thereof, or denial or delay of permits and rights-of-way.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRYThere are utilization risks with respect to our assets.With respect to our Liquids Pipelines assets, we may be exposed to throughput risk on the Canadian Mainline depending upon the tolling framework we adopt for that system, and we are exposed to throughput risk under certain tolling agreements applicable to other Liquids Pipelines assets, such as the Lakehead System. A decrease in volumes transported can directly and adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Factors such as changing market fundamentals, capacity bottlenecks, regulatory restrictions, maintenance and operational incidents on our system and upstream or downstream facilities, and increased competition can all impact the utilization of our assets. Market fundamentals, such as commodity prices and price differentials, weather, gasoline price and consumption, alternative and new energy sources and technologies, and global supply disruptions outside of our control can impact both the supply of and demand for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons transported on our pipelines.47With respect to our Gas Transmission and Midstream assets, gas supply and demand dynamics continue to change due to shifts in regional and global production and consumption. These shifts can lead to fluctuations in commodity prices and price differentials, resulting in oversupply of pipeline takeaway capacity in some areas and an adverse effect to the utilization of our systems. Other factors affecting system utilization include operational incidents, regulatory restrictions, system maintenance, and increased competition.With respect to our Gas Distribution and Storage assets, customers are billed on both a fixed charge and volumetric basis and our ability to collect the total revenue requirement (the cost of providing service, including a reasonable return to the utility) depends on achieving the forecast distribution volume established in the rate-making process. The probability of realizing such volume is contingent upon four key forecast variables: weather, economic conditions, pricing of competitive energy sources and growth in the number of customers. Weather is a significant driver of delivery volumes, given that a significant portion of our Gas Distribution customer base uses natural gas for space heating. Distribution volume may also be impacted by the increased adoption of energy efficient technologies, along with more efficient building construction, that continue to place downward pressure on consumption. In addition, conservation efforts by customers may further contribute to a decline in annual average consumption. Sales and transportation service to large volume commercial and industrial customers is more susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. As well, the pricing of competitive energy sources affects volume distributed to these sectors as some customers have the ability to switch to an alternate fuel. Even in those circumstances where we attain our respective total forecast distribution volume, our Gas Distribution business may not earn its expected ROE due to other forecast variables, such as the mix between the higher margin residential and commercial sectors and the lower margin industrial sector. Our Gas Distribution business remains at risk for the actual versus forecast large volume contract commercial and industrial volumes.With respect to our Renewable Power Generation assets, earnings from these assets are highly dependent on weather and atmospheric conditions as well as continued operational availability of these energy producing assets. While the expected energy yields for Renewable Power Generation projects are predicted using long-term historical data, wind and solar resources are subject to natural variation from year-to-year and from season-to-season. Any prolonged reduction in wind or solar resources at any of the Renewable Power Generation facilities could lead to decreased earnings and cash flows. Additionally, inefficiencies or interruptions of Renewable Power Generation facilities due to operational disturbances or outages resulting from weather conditions or other factors, could also impact earnings.Our assets vary in age and were constructed over many decades which causes our inspection, maintenance or repair costs to increase.Our pipelines vary in age and were constructed over many decades. Pipelines are generally long-lived assets, and pipeline construction and coating techniques have changed over time. Depending on the era of construction and construction techniques, some assets require more frequent inspections, which has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures in the future. Any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.48Competition may result in a reduction in demand for our services, fewer project opportunities or assumption of risk that results in weaker or more volatile financial performance than expected.Our Liquids Pipelines business faces competition from competing carriers available to ship liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the US and internationally and from proposed pipelines that seek to access basins and markets currently served by our Liquids Pipelines. Competition among existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets. The liquids transported in our pipelines currently, or are expected to increasingly, compete with other emerging alternatives for end-users, including, but not limited to, electric batteries, biofuels, and hydrogen. Additionally, we face competition from alternative storage facilities. Our natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The natural gas transported in our business also competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, and renewable energy. Our Renewable Power Generation business faces competition in the procurement of long-term power purchase agreements and from other fuel sources in the markets in which we operate. Competition in all of our businesses, including competition for new project development opportunities, could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Completion of our secured projects and maintenance programs are subject to various regulatory, operational and market risks, which may affect our ability to drive long-term growth.Our project execution continues to face challenges with intense scrutiny on regulatory and environmental permit applications, politicized permitting, public opposition including protests, action to repeal permits, and resistance to land access.Continued challenges with global supply chains have created unpredictability in materials cost and availability. Labor shortages and union strikes have increased costs of engineering and construction services.Other events that can and have delayed project completion and increased anticipated costs include contractor or supplier non-performance, extreme weather events or geological factors beyond our control.Changing expectations of stakeholders regarding ESG practices and climate change could erode stakeholder trust and confidence, damage our reputation and influence actions or decisions about our company and industry and have negative impacts on our business, operations or financial results.Companies across all sectors and industries are facing changing expectations or increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their approach to ESG matters of greatest relevance to their business and to their stakeholders. For energy companies, climate change, GHG emissions, safety and stakeholder and Indigenous relations remain primary focus areas, while other environmental elements such as biodiversity and supply chain are ascendant. Companies in the energy industry are experiencing stakeholder opposition to new and existing infrastructure, as well as organized opposition to oil and natural gas extraction and shipment of oil and natural gas products. Changing expectations of our practices and performance across these ESG areas may impose additional costs or create exposure to new or additional risks. We are also exposed to the risk of higher costs, delays, project cancellations, loss of ability to secure new growth opportunities, new restrictions or the cessation of operations of existing pipelines due to increasing pressure on governments and regulators, and legal action, such as the legal challenges to the operation of Line 5 in Michigan and Wisconsin.Our operations, projects and growth opportunities require us to have strong relationships with key stakeholders, including local communities, Indigenous groups and others directly impacted by our activities, as well as governments, regulatory agencies, investors and investor advocacy groups, investment funds, financial institutions, insurers and others, which are increasingly focused on ESG practices and performance.49Enhanced public awareness of climate change has driven an increase in demand for lower-carbon and zero-emissions energy. Over the past year, the invasion of Ukraine and inflationary pressure following the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the critical need for access to secure affordable energy. Enbridge has a long history of diversifying its portfolio of businesses to align with the mix of energy that people need and want. The pace and scale of the transition to a lower-emission economy may pose a risk if Enbridge diversifies either too quickly or too slowly. Similarly, unexpected shifts in energy demands, including due to climate change concerns, can impact revenue through reduced throughput volumes on our pipeline transportation systems.We have long been committed to strong ESG practices, performance and reporting, and in 2020 introduced a set of ESG goals to strengthen transparency and accountability. The goals include increasing diversity and inclusion within our organization and reducing GHG emissions from our operations to net-zero by 2050, with corporate and business unit action plans aligned to our strategic priority to adapt to the energy transition over time. The costs associated with meeting our ESG goals, including our GHG emissions reduction goals, could be significant. There is also a risk that some or all of the expected benefits and opportunities of achieving our ESG goals may fail to materialize, may cost more than anticipated to achieve, may not occur within the anticipated time periods or may no longer meet changing stakeholder expectations. Similarly, there is a risk that emissions reduction technologies do not materialize as expected making it more difficult to reduce emissions. If we are not able to achieve our ESG goals, are not able to meet current and future climate, emissions or related reporting requirements of regulators, or are unable to meet or manage current and future expectations regarding issues important to investors or other stakeholders (including those related to climate change), it could erode stakeholder trust and confidence, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, operations or financial results. Potential impacts could also include changing investor sentiment regarding investment in Enbridge or impair our access to and increase our cost of capital, including penalties associated with our sustainability-linked financing.Our forecasted assumptions may not materialize as expected, including on our expansion projects, acquisitions and divestitures.We evaluate expansion projects, acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis. Planning and investment analysis is highly dependent on accurate forecasting assumptions and to the extent that these assumptions do not materialize, financial performance may be lower or more volatile than expected. Volatility and unpredictability in the economy, both locally and globally, and changes in cost estimates, project scoping and risk assessment could result in a loss of profits. Similarly, uncertainty in market signals, such as abrupt and unexpected shifts in energy costs and demands, as we saw in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted, and may in the future impact, revenue through reduced throughput volumes on our pipeline transportation systems.Our insurance coverage may not fully cover our losses in the event of an accident, natural disaster or other hazardous event, and we may encounter increased cost arising from the maintenance of, or lack of availability of, insurance.Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in our industry. Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause, and in some cases have caused, personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations.We maintain an insurance program for us, our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates to mitigate a certain portion of our risks. However, not all potential risks arising from our operations are insurable, or are insured by us as a result of availability, high premiums and for various other reasons. The Company self-insures a significant portion of certain risks through our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, and the Company’s insurance coverage is subject to terms and conditions, exclusions and large deductibles or self-insured retentions which may reduce or eliminate coverage in certain circumstances.50The Company’s insurance policies are generally renewed on an annual basis and, depending on factors such as market conditions, the premiums, terms, policy limits and/or deductibles can vary substantially. We can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates or on other terms we consider commercially reasonable. In such case, we may decide to self-insure additional risks.A significant self-insured loss, uninsured loss, a loss significantly exceeding the limits of our insurance policies, a significant delay in the payment of a major insurance claim, or the failure to renew insurance policies on similar or favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, counterparties, and vendors.We are exposed to the credit risk of multiple parties in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment-grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or provide us security to satisfy credit concerns. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in the creditworthiness of our customers, vendors, or counterparties. It is possible that payment or performance defaults from these entities, if significant, could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.Our business is exposed to changes in market prices including interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Our risk management policies cannot eliminate all risks and may result in material financial losses. In addition, any non-compliance with our risk management policies could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.Our use of debt financing exposes us to changes in interest rates on both future fixed rate debt issuances and floating rate debt. While our financial results are denominated in Canadian dollars, many of our businesses have foreign currency revenues or expenses, particularly the US dollar. Changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could materially impact our financial results. We use financial derivatives to manage risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices, power prices and our share price to reduce volatility of our cash flows. Based on our risk management policies, substantially all of our financial derivatives are associated with an underlying asset, liability and/or forecasted transaction and not intended for speculative purposes. These policies cannot, however, eliminate all risk, including unauthorized trading. Although this activity is monitored independently by our Risk Management function, we can provide no assurance that we will detect and prevent all unauthorized trading and other violations, particularly if deception, collusion or other intentional misconduct is involved, and any such violations could adversely affect our business, operations or financial results.In addition, to the extent that we hedge our foreign exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices, we will forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if these were to change in our favor. In addition, hedging activities can result in losses that might be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such losses have occurred in the past and could occur in the future. See Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and",2023-12-30 20:14:08.023177
